            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Time would fail me, if I ſhould endeavour to tranſcribe what <hi>Plato, Euripides, Cato, Cicero, Juvenal, Plutarch,</hi> and many other Heathens have written to this purpoſe; nay, the whole Works of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> may well bear this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>An Apology for Piety and Virtue.</hi> And what is the ſcope of <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Perſeus</hi> their Satyrs, but to declaim againſt the vices of their time? We ſhall then only from thoſe rich Gardens, collect and gather ſome few Flowers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome known principles of moral Philoſophy, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former calumnies which are ſo eaſily believed, and to the courſe which is ſo generally followed by blind Atheiſts. <hi>Ah!</hi> (ſaith the Satyriſt) <hi>virtue and goodneſs is the only true Nobility; he deſerveth no praiſe, whoſe praiſe is only from his Anceſtors; ſince</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> (5) obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) <hi>the womb and the grave are two great levellers, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alike as to their birth and death; and therefore none can be more noble or magnanimous then another, but he who hath the moſt generous ſpirit, and who is moſt eminent in virtue and goodneſs; and he</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) <hi>muſt be moſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47554:3"/>baſe and miſerable, who is moſt wicked and flagitious.</hi> And accordingly, <hi>Euripides</hi> (6) well concludeth, <hi>that it is a great abuſe to call profane, godleſs wretches, noble and excellent, albeit they had never ſo many followers and great poſſeſſions: And hence the old Romans did ſo ſituat</hi> (7) <hi>the temples of virtue and honour, that there was no acceſs to that of honour, but by the other of virtue; and thus alſo, honour from the great</hi> (8) <hi>Philoſopher and great</hi> (9) <hi>Orator, is commonly deſcribed the</hi> reward of virtue.</p>
            <p>And as thus the good and virtuous are the only honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and noble, So <hi>they are</hi> (according to <hi>Cicero</hi>) <hi>the only rich and happy:</hi> (10) <hi>true wealth conſiſts not in moveables, what can be loſt or taken from us, is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neither mine nor thine: and virtue is that only treaſure that cannot be removed; he who driveth that trade needs not fear ſtorms or pirats by Sea, nor robbers and perils by Land; nay,</hi> (as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith) <hi>death cannot take away its</hi> (11) <hi>praiſe or reward, but that will follow us when we muſt leave all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, honours and injoyments.</hi>

            <p>Ah!

And therefore do we now offer this brief lecture of Divinity from theſe Moraliſts, that it might appear, that none can forſake and oppoſe the way of righteouſneſs and holineſs, but he who hath caſt off both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47554:4"/>reaſon and humanity, and who doth become a brute, leſt he ſhould be a Saint.

               <hi>Zarah</hi> hath drawn back his hand, while this <hi>Pharez</hi> hath broken forth. Having (not long after the Lord called me to the Miniſtery) made choice of our bleſſed Lords fare-well Sermon, <hi>Joh. 14.</hi> &amp;c. (that ſweet and excellent portion of Scripture) to be the ground and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Doctrine <hi>I</hi> was to preach to this people every Lords day in the fore-noon, (reſerving for the afternoon ſome word of warning, exhortation, reproof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Lord would direct me, and their need and the occaſion did require) when I came to the <hi>13.</hi> and <hi>14.</hi> verſes of that <hi>14.</hi> Chapter, which contain ſuch an ample and full promiſe concerning the ſucceſs and return of prayer, (as a moſt powerfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſerious and conſtant practice of that duty, and as a reviving cordial and notable incouragement under all our tryals and afflictions) I reſolved to ſtay a while on that excellent and uſefull Theme, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choice of ſuteable Texts for unfolding the ſeveral particulars which belong to that head; not having then the leaſt thought to publiſh theſe Sermons; eſpecially conſidering, that ſo many able Divines had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laboured in that field: but when I obſerved my Meditations to pitch on thoſe things I had not met with in thoſe Authors, I looked upon that as an invitation to proſecute that work, and to write at length what I purpoſed to deliver, and not to mark only ſome brief notes (as my cuſtom for the moſt part is) of what I was to enlarge in the Pulpit. And having brought that work to ſome cloſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47554:22"/>though I was conſcious of my own weakneſs, and not ignorant how critical this luxuriant age is; yet I did at laſt give way to the publiſhing of it, when I conſidered, that the times call for ſuch a Peece, (though performed with greater dexterity) having alſo met with ſome invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and incouragement from ſome who occaſionally heard, and others who had ſeen ſome of theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>So much briefly concerning the riſe and deſign; and having in the ſubſequent Preface, ſpoken a little of the excellency, neceſſity, uſefullneſs, ſingular advantages, ſucceſs and fruit of Prayer, which is the <hi>ſubject;</hi> I ſhall now only offer ſome few advertiſements concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> it ſelf. And, <hi>1.</hi> ſince few or none (whom I had ſeen or could hear of) have handled, at any length, thoſe queſtions that belong to the nature of Prayer, I have inſiſted on theſe the more largely, (not leaving them without ſome practical application) Part firſt; and as to the reſt of the Tractat, I have but briefly touched ſuch particulars as have been more fully proſecuted by others. And thus, <hi>2.</hi> ſince a great part of Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> diſcourſe of Prayer, is ſpent upon the qualifications of that ſpiritual Sacrifice, I have, Part ſecond, only in a word, named thoſe be inſiſteth on, adding ſome few, with a more full explication of that faith, required <hi>Jam. 1.6.</hi> ſince I conceived not only him, but others who had ſpoken to that caſe, not to inſiſt on that which is the main importance thereof. <hi>3.</hi> As to the caſes propounded, Part third, theſe are but few, and I have only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the firſt two, as being moſt uſefull and material; and the third (I might alſo add the ſecond, as belonging to this head, yea and the firſt alſo, except what the learned Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> hath offered for clearing of it) hath ſcarcely been named by any practical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine I have peruſed. As to the kinds of Prayer, ſuch as ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and more continued, cloſet Prayer and publick, extraordinary and ordinary, ſet-forms and <hi>extempore,</hi> &amp;c. I have not deſcended to theſe; as for other reaſons, ſo becauſe the judicious Mr. <hi>Curnal</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Armour, Part 3.</hi> hath lately handled theſe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the laſt we named) very accuratly.</p>
            <p>As to the fourth Part, concerning the ſucceſs and anſwer of Prayer, the firſt Table will give thee an account of the particulars there handled: but what theſe two great Divines, Mr. <hi>Gee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> have at ſo great length delivered in two compleat Treatiſes, the one <hi>Concerning the return of Prayer;</hi> the other <hi>Concerning the reaſons of Gods hiding himſelf from his peoples prayers, grounded on his promiſes; and of his ſeeming, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, to anſwer the prayers which are contrary thereunto,</hi> I have in few words ſummed up; propounding the chief heads of their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47554:22"/>large Diſcourſe, with ſome additional obſervations, in ſix or ſeven Pages, it is then far from my thoughts to render the labours of others who have written before me, on this excellent and moſt comprehenſive head, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but their Works will be neceſſary to ſupply my defects and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet I have not altogether omitted any thing I conceived ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to belong to the preſent Subject.</p>
            <p>If it be askt, whether I now offer theſe Sermons as they were preach'd? <hi>Anſ.</hi> There will be found no conſiderable alteration, as to the practicall part, except that I did then enlarge ſome particulars and inſiſt longer upon them, when I conceived the need of this people ſo to require; but that defect is here ſupplied with addition of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral polemick Queſtions (eſpecially Part <hi>1.</hi>) and Citations, which had not been pertinent for ſuch an Auditory, nor from ſuch a place; however uſefull School-debates may be to the learned and judicious, yet to the multitude they prove but a beating of the air; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they may invite and delight an intelligent Reader, (and the unlearned may paſs them over and go to that which is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) yet the Preacher would minde all his hearers, eſpecially the moſt rude and ignorant, (for others might better provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that when he is to give an account of his ſtewardſhip, he may be able to ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>That his preaching was not with the inticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.4.</hi> and, <hi>That in the Church, he did rather ſpeak five words to the capacity of his hearers, then ten thouſand they did not underſtand, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the errors in printing, theſe I obſerved by a curſory view, are ſo many, that I dare not under take to give a perfect catalogue; but let me intreat thee, before thou read, to correct with thy pen theſe which I have here ſet down, as being moſt material; eſpecially that blaſphemy in the Preface, <hi>Page 2.</hi> where in ſtead of <hi>juſtice,</hi> thou wilt find <hi>injuſtice</hi> aſcribed to the holy One of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As to to the marginal citations, I had not time to compare them with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and I did the rather forbear that task, becauſe there be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authors I peruſed in writing, which I have not now beſide me (for this ſmall Treatiſe hath lyen in the Preſs theſe two years almoſt, the Printer having met with ſome diverſions) therefore I have only corrected ſome few errors, (or, ſhall I ſay, non-ſenſe) in the matter: but as to the places cited, thou wilt find one and the ſame paſſage made uſe of (ſome few pages only interjected) with a divers citation, and the Authors names ſometimes ſo mangled, that hardly wilt thou be able to conjecture who they be, as <hi>Pet. art. 8. Joſ de,</hi> for <hi>Pet. a S. Joſ. ide. habet</hi> for <hi>Bernard. Aug. juſt.</hi> for <hi>Auguſt. Calv.</hi> for <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,

As to the numberal figures on the ſeveral pages, there are ſo many miſtakes, that it were not eaſie to ſum them all up; but the moſt obſervable is, that from page, <hi>544.</hi> to page <hi>649.</hi> there is an hundred leſs then the juſt number; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent confuſion, I have in the tables ſupplyed what was wanting, and have followed the number wherewith the page ought to have been marked. Thou wilt alſo now and then find ſome miſtake in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the pages, and that the deſignation of the <hi>Part, Chapter</hi> and <hi>Section</hi> is wanting, and that in the page the ſeveral purpoſes are not diſtinguiſhed with their proper paragraphs. Thou wilt moreover often find <hi>leaſt</hi> for <hi>leſt,</hi> and in the firſt ſeven or eight ſheets the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>to,</hi> once and again, ſuperfluouſly added, in which the Printer made uſe of that coppy (having two) <hi>I</hi> did not write nor reviſe.

It is thought one of the moſt tolerable and eaſy tasks to pray; and every one (as they think) is able and ſit enough for ſuch an employment, and are buſie enough in carrying on that trade, and they were not worthy to live (will ſuch ſay) who do not call upon God: But ah! Who are they that are acquainted with the miſtery of Prayer? Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour is indeed an eaſy work; the Popiſh devotion, the whiting the out-ſide of the Sepulchre, is no difficult task, but it is not ſo eaſie to give life to the loathſom carcaſſe within; thou mayeſt draw nigh the Throne and prattle ſome few words before the Lord, and yet never put to one finger to the work, if thou do not put out thy ſtrength to draw up thy dead lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh heart; if thou find not a burthen preſſing thee and it down, and call not to heaven for help and for fire to kindle and enlive thy ſacrifice. Every key will not open the doors of Heaven; every knock will not obtain an entrance, nor every cry prevail: Let us then look up to Him who can only give us that wiſdom which is from above; who can diſcover, bring to our hands, and help us to uſe that admirable piece of work, that it may not only prove a key to open the Fountain, the Store-houſe door and all our fathers Cabins, but alſo for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our hearts, and an hammer to break the hard rocks of corruption and the ſtone there. Ah! But who is ſufficient

A word ſpoken on ſuch a ſubject can never be unſeaſonable; and though many have put in their Sickle here, yet much of the harveſt is un cut down: But more hath been ſaid then rightly improven; though the Lord hath ſtirred up ſo many of His Meſſengers to point out the way to the Throne, and how to carry on a ſafe trade with Heaven; yet, who hath believed their report? And we ſhall not think our labour loſt in bearing teſtimony againſt this ſinning and prayerleſſe Generation; nor ſhall we ſtand upon an Apology for making choice of ſuch a Theme. Alas!

Ah! Who would pitty ſuch a fool in his miſery? And yet, who doth lay to heart that he is the man, and that this is his own caſe and condition; while we are in the<note n="(r)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</note> earthly houſe of this Tabernacle we are Pilgrims and Strangers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. verſ. 13. We are far from home but our father is not unmindfull of us, He lets us not want Bonds and Bills of Exchange under the broad Seal of Heaven, and ſo cannot be loſt; they are regiſtred in the ſacred Volume, and we may have an extract when we will. We have the credit and fidelity of the great King morgaged (as it were) for our ſecurity; and that He who gives (which is ſingular) will alſo anſwer theſe credential Letters; only they are as ſo many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47554:27"/>black Bonds, and thou canſt lay no claim to them till thy name be inſerted. And our kind Father, from time to time, doth warn us, entreating that we would fill up the blank; that we would become willing and content to be happy and rich; that we would pray for an heart to prize the heavenly Treaſure, and for an hand to write-in our name in theſe evidences; to write it with a pen of Iron and the point of a Diamond, there to abide for ever: And then that we would ask a tongue wherewith we may plead at the mercy ſeat the performance of theſe promiſes, and that God would anſwer his owne bills.</p>
            <p>And thus Prayer is that Manna on which the true Iſraelite can live and uſe it for all kind of food. The Rabbins imagine that whatſoever kind of meat the Jewes deſired and longed for, their Manna while they did eat it, did perfectly relliſh the ſame. Certainly this our Manna will ſuite with, can anſwer and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all ſorts of appetits; nay it will ſerve not only for meat but alſo for medicine; in every caſe and condition, for every buſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and in all things Prayer is uſefull, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 6.

What is ſaid of the whole of holines in generall, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. may fitly be applyed to Prayer in particular; it is profitable for all things, it is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and happy meſſenger which alwaies returnes with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of peace.</p>
            <p>But that we may ſtay no longer in the porch in handling this moſt weighty point (which may be called the marrow and ſum of practicall divinity) we purpoſe in the Lords ſtrength to follow this method. 1. We will enquire after the nature of Prayer and endeavour to ſhew what it is. 2.

               <p>THere be too many theaters in the world, who with their counterfeit money deceive the ſimple, yet there are moe who with ſuch coyn would carry on a trade with heaven; and who dare offer to him, from whoſe eyes nothing is hid, ſuch traſh and refuſe: but he cannot be mockt, he will not owne or accept what hath not the ſtamp of his ſpirit. Carnal deſires, though vehement and fervent, muſt not be called Prayers; they deſerve not the name of crying unto him, and though they flow

                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8.14.</note> and to diſcover the halt and the lame, that we may not dare to offer ſuch corrupt things to the great King, whoſe name is dreadfull in all the earth, leaſt he ſpread upon our faces the dung of our ſacrifices.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2, 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And now in the entrance we would obſerve, that Prayer may fall under a fourfold notion and conſideration. 1. As a Gift. 2. As a Grace. 3. As a Duty. 4. As a mean appointed of God for obtaining the good things he hath promiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wicked men as they may be eminent for parts and other gifts; ſo alſo, as to the gift of Prayer, they may tender up an excellent ſupplication, both for matter and expreſſion, to the delight and edification of the hearers, and to the emolument and good of thoſe who joyn with them, but with another heart: Gifts abuſed, though they profit not the receiver (but exceedingly aggravate his guiltineſs) yet they may tend to the ſpiritual advantage of others; why might not theſe work-men who built an ark for <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, periſh in the deluge?</p>
               <p>But, 2. As many graceleſſe ſouls may have the gift of Prayer, So many precious ones may want that gift as to any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent meaſure and degree; they may poure out their ſouls before the Lord with much affection and tenderneſs, who being of ſmall parts, have not this gift, for the edification, refreſhing and ſtirring up the affections of others; yet I have known not a few, who as for naturall parts, have been reputed weak and ſimple, and who have had no great dexterity in worldly affairs, yet have been eminent, not only for grace, but alſo in the gift of Prayer, the Spirit (according to the Word <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.) helping their infirmities, and enabling them to pray as they ought; not only by enlarging their hearts with holy deſires: but alſo ordering theſe deſires, and ſupplying fit and pertinent words for expreſſing of them, to the admiration
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47554:29"/>of the hearers; yet it is too evident, that many of the ſaints want this Gift as to any conſiderable meaſure; who albeit upon this account they may be humbled, and with ſubmiſſon complain to God becauſe of this infirmity, yet need not be too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, though the Lord hath not beſtowed on them ſuch a meaſure of knowledge and utterance as upon ſome others, yet he hath not with-held from them the Spirit of grace and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. What though thou canſt but ſigh with the needy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5.) and groan with the Priſoners? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.20. What though thou canſt but chatter as a cran, and mourn as a dove? <hi>Iſ.</hi> 38.14.5. The Lord can read and underſtand that hand-writting, he knows the meaning of abrupt and broken words proceeding from a broken and contrite ſpirit, and will perform the deſire of ſuch diſconſolat ones.</p>
               <p>As for the two latter conſiderations, there is an uſuall miſtake on both hands, carnall hearts, who make little conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of duty, look on Prayer as a mean; and the Saints, who dar not omit their duty, too often, forget the reward: theſe who ask amiſſe and cannot lay claim to the promiſe, yet will uſe Prayer as a charm and ſpel, they fear no evill becauſe they ſay their Prayers every day, and the true Iſraelits who may draw nigh to God as a father in confidence to be heard, ſo trade with heaven as if a ſtorm did alwayes follow them when they went to ſea, and as if their veſſell could not eſcape the Pirats: and thus though they will not be idle, but muſt hazard and ſend many Packs to ſea, yet they expect not ever to hear of them again; and though the Lord pitty ſuch, and will not deal with them according to their fears, yet often he hideth his face for a while, and maketh them meet with many contrair blaſts, becauſe of their diffidence; that though their Ship come ſafe to ſhoar at length, yet the voyage proveth uncomfortable and dangerous, and a conſiderable time may interveen before they hear of their return.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſpeak of Prayer under all theſe four reſpects; But O! if the Lord would be pleaſed ſo to bleſſe theſe weak en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that they may prove helpfull for preventing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, where the Lord requires an union, that all of us may have ſuch a meaſure of the ſpirit of <hi>grace</hi> poured out upon us, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47554:30"/>may, 2. be furniſhed with ſuch gifts and abilities for ordering &amp; expreſſing our deſires. And may, 3. be ſo inabled to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our duty; As that 4. We may go about the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it with cheerfulneſs and confidence, knowing that we ſhall not ſeek his face in vain; that thus grace may ſanctifie our gifts, and ſucceſſe may accompany our work; that albeit to our apprehenſion there muſt ſtill be a diſtinction; yet there may be no more a ſeparation, but that in all our ſupplications theſe may joyn hand in hand, and may be really united; ſo that we ſhall not need to proſecute the difference any further, only as occaſion ſhall offer, we will adde a word, by way of remedy, for curing or preventing what may be found wanting or amiſſe in our Prayers as to any of theſe reſpects and conſiderations, looking up to Him, who only can<note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <p>DIvers names and expreſſions (if the difference be not meerly literal and grammatical) muſt contribute not a little for clearing of the nature of the thing it ſelf; it will not then be impertinent for us here to ponder a little the different wayes whereby the ſubject of our preſent enquiry is expreſſed in Scripture, eſpecially ſince ſuch a view in the porch (ſome brief obſervations for explication being intermixed) may help to prevent a double miſtake, the one of carnall hearts, who becauſe they find Prayer ſome times held forth under words that ſeem to import no great difficulty, ſeriouſneſs and diligence, as to <hi>ask, ſeek, call, cry, knock,</hi> &amp;c. are ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47554:30"/>that it is an eaſie task to pray, and that they need no further trouble themſelves, if they can utter ſome few words in a formall way: and on the other hand, the Godly hearing of ſuch importunity in Prayer, ſuch fervency, watchfulneſſe, perſeverance, wreſtling, weeping, &amp;c. are in hazard to draw hard concluſions againſt themſelves, as if they never had yet prayed acceptably.</p>
               <p>Albeit now we may not ſpeak at any length to theſe material caſes, it being one of the main deſigns of the practicall part of this treatiſe to give ſome clearing to theſe; yet, for the preſent, we may ſet before both the preſuming Atheiſt and the tender Chriſtian, what, through the bleſſing of God, may prove a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to both, if they will be at the pains to compare theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together; and thus ſeek after the ſenſe. Carnall men may ſee that there is difficulty in the work, and that lip-labour is no Prayer; and the Godly, who offer up the deſire of their heart to God, need not be diſcouraged, though at all times they have not ſuch enlarged affections, zeal and continuance, as ſome of Gods children upon ſpeciall occaſions have had. And as this parallel, may now be helpfull to that purpoſe; So it may give ſome light, when we come to ſpeak of theſe caſes more fully in the qualifications of Prayer, and to what we are to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of it here, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> will queſtion and diſpute for and againſt in theſe points that are ſo certain and undenyable? As, 1. If it be convenient to pray. 2.

For upon good ground it may be inquired, if the Popiſh Devotion be convenient? and if their lip-labour and moving of the tongue, without attention and affection, (as we ſhall<note n="(e)" place="margin">Set part <hi>2.</hi> chap.</note> hear themſelves confeſs) yea, and without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (while they pray in an unknown language) be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious act, and deſerve the name of divine Worſhip? and we may confidently affirm, that to dally thus in Gods ſervice, and to teach others to do ſo, is a notable injury againſt the infinite Majeſty of God, an impious and blaſphemous mockrie of the Omni-ſcient and holy One, who muſt be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. and with the whole heart, as too little to offer unto Him (if we had more to give) and too naughty to be imployed in His worſhip: Nay, this doth not only ſavour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47554:33"/>of the pagan and heatheniſh deluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that much babling is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. but alſo of the Satanicall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of Witches and Charmers, who are well acquainted with ſuch ſort of prayers, as fit engines for accompliſhing their helliſh deſignes; that kind of prayer, being, as it were, the Devils <hi>A. B. C.</hi> which he firſt teacheth his ſchollars, which he will indeed anſwer, becauſe they are abominable to God; and that thus he may delude and allure theſe miſerable wretches and keep them in his ſnare: What kind of teachers then muſt theſe be, that dare affirm that God will hear and accept ſuch Prayers? Theſe muſt be the ſeducing ſpirits (of whom the Apoſtle warneth us, whoſe lot hath fallen in the latter times, to beware, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 1.) who teach the doctrine of Devils, having their conſcience ſeared with a hot iron.</p>
               <p>O! but you will then ſay, what is the Prayer that God will hear and accept? For anſwer, we might bring many emphatick ſentences and expreſſions of the ancient Doctours of the Church, (who in their meditations have rather been taken up with its excellency, ſweetneſs and uſefulneſs, then its nature and theorie) which though they may ſuffice for ſtopping the foul mouths of Popiſh Caſuiſts and Schoolmen, yet they are rather Rethoricall commendations then deſcriptions of this great duty; but of late, ſince learning became more poliſhed, every one (almoſt) who hath ſpoken to this point, hath given, as it were, a new definition; and it were no difficult task in us to do the like. But ſince all the diverſitie is rather in words and phraſes then in the matter, we could wiſh that all would reſt on that which doth moſt fully and clearly explain the thing; and thus (as we conceive) in our Catechiſme, Prayer is excellently well<note n="(f)" place="margin">Joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether what is ſaid both in the larger and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Catechiſme</note> deſcribed <hi>an offering up of our deſires to God for things agreable to his will, in the name of Chriſt by the help of his ſpirit, with confeſſion of our ſins, and thankfull acknowledgment of his mercies.</hi> Here, 1. we have the act it ſelf ſpecified. 2.

The outward ſenſes ſhould covenant, not to offer to the affections ſuch baits and allurements, nor to caſt in their way ſuch golden apples, as may interrupt and impede them in their motion towards the Throne, and may call them back from heaven to earth. 5. The will it ſelf, the main agent and leader, muſt be ſet a work by ſpiritual aimes and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if the end and ſcope be baſe and naught, the motion is loſt, though never ſo ſwift and vigorous; and both will and underſtanding ſhould be moſt ſerious in their attention, 1.

               <p>And thus Prayer doth formally and primarily conſiſt in an act of the will; and it is <hi>an offering up of our deſires to God;</hi> it is not the ſimple act of deſiring: For, then <hi>to deſire</hi> and <hi>to pray</hi> were all one; and carnal voluptuous, ambitious and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious men, who have ſaid to the Lord, (with theſe miſcreants, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14.) depart from us; for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes, and what profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him? even thoſe men who are ſo great ſtrangers and enemies to Prayer, are big with deſires, having as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire as luſts. Every deſire then is not a Prayer, but a deſire ſo and ſo qualified; a deſire directed and offered up to God.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not imagine, that our heart ſtands in need of a meſſenger, to carry and preſent its deſires before the Throne; it hath a tongue to ſpeak for it ſelf, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27.8.

Or, 2. Doth the Lord ſtand in need of a trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? ſhall he who ſearcheth the heart and trieth the reins; he who knoweth what is in man, and needeth not that any ſhould teſtifie of man, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10.) go to another, and ask, what are the purpoſes and deſires of the heart?</p>
               <p>Though then we deny not the concurrence of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but wiſh, that all that is within us may joyn, and were imployed in this ſpiritual and ſolemn exerciſe; yet, all the faculties of the ſoul, are as ſo many attendants to wait upon the heart, till it draw nigh, direct it's deſires, and preſent it's ſupplications to the great King.</p>
               <p>But, let none miſtake, as if we thought, that the will, by a new act did reflect upon it's deſires, and thereby did order and offer them to God. 1. Such a reflexion, will be found contrary to experience; if any will deſcend into his own heart, and look back upon his own actings, he will not find it there, or that he ſtood in need of any ſuch new act. And, 2. it will be hard to ſhew what ſuch a reflex act did import, and to what kind of volition it ſhould be referred. The will then, by one and the ſame act, and in the ſame inſtant of time deſireth, and deſireth from God: as one and the ſame act is, 1. the deſire of the ſoul; and, 2. the deſire of ſuch an object; So, 3. from ſuch an hand and fountain; Yea, ſome, with<note n="(u)" place="margin">Scal. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. <hi>317. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderium,</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi de ſideribus, quod res deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derata expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetur de caelo.</note>

Directed to God. And, 3. referred to ſuch and ſuch an end. And only to our apprehenſion, and for diſtinctions ſake, theſe ſeverall reſpects and formalities, are differenced as to Prayer, where they ſhould be really united in one and the ſame act; but yet, there is ground for ſuch a diſtinction and preciſion, ſince every deſire is not directed towards God, nor doth aime at a right end. And thus, for explications ſake, we may affirm, that in Prayer there is a kind of<note n="(y)" place="margin">no imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing (ſuch as the will and its actings) is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any proper and quantitative dimenſion and extenſion.</note> 
                  <hi>Extenſion</hi> and enlarging of deſires 1. to the right fountain, for a ſupply; and, 2. to the right end and marke. And, 3. to the right rule, for bounding and limiting of it, both as to matter and manner; ſo that Prayer formally, and as ſuch, doth import not the deſire it ſelf, (which is, as it were, the <hi>materiale,</hi> and in it ſelf <hi>conſidered,</hi> is indifferent and determinable otherwiſe) but this <hi>Offering</hi> and <hi>directing of our deſires to God;</hi> for thereby deſires acted and powred out by way of Prayer, are diſtinguiſhed from all other deſires, which want this qualification, and deſerve not the name of Prayer. But alwayes it would be remembred, that this Chriſtian ſacrifice, is not like the material and Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall oblations: for, every one, (as being a preiſt to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.) may offer up his own ſacrifice. Chriſt indeed muſt be our Altar and high Prieſt, and the holy Spirit, muſt bring fire and incenſe; but the heart it ſelf, muſt offer up its own deſires; it needs not run to another Prieſt, nor employ the mind and underſtanding to take its offering, and preſent it to God.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed for explication, let us now col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from Scripture, ſome few reaſons, not ſo much to ſtop the mouths of ſubtile diſputers, as to convince negligent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of their ſin, and to minde them of that which is the life and main ingredient of this ſolemn performance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What we are now to ſpeak concerning Chriſts interceſſion may be referred to theſe heads. 1. We ſhall conſider how the Scripture expreſſeth that point. 2. We will ſhew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what nature it is performed. 3. After what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 4. We will draw ſome conſolatory inferences. 5. We will point out the grounds of this interceſſion. And, 6. We will move ſome queſtions, and obviat objections.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, if we compare thoſe Scriptures which moſt expreſly hold out this point, we may obſerve theſe ſeveral ſteps and (as it were) degrees of Chriſts interceſſion. And, 1. in the general, He is ſaid to appear in the preſence of God for us; not determining the manner how, nor the conſideration under which, nor upon what account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. But, 2. we have His office deſigned, He (while now in the heavens) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth there as a Mediator between God and man, ready to tryſt and interpoſe for their reconciliation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. but not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47554:43"/>as a neutral, and as one not concerned in the matter. But, 3.2 our friend on our ſide, and a tryſter and factor for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. Yea, 4 as engaged by office to plead for us, He appeareth as our Prieſt to deal and interceed for us, His people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. Yea, 5. as being yet more tender towards us, and more neerly concerned in us: He appeareth there as our Surety and Cautioner to pay our ranſom, and to offer what Law and Juſtice can claim for the priſoners liberty; and that He may become, not only our redemption and atonement, and to ſatisfie for debt already contracted; but alſo to become Surety for our future carriage, and to become our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom and ſanctification, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. And then, 6. He appears as our Advocat, not like the Levitical Prieſts only to plead mercy, but as an Advocat in point of Law and juſtice, to plead, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whoſe ranſom He hath paid, may be ſet at liberty, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. He will not only, as an agent, requeſt and ſolliſt, (though thus alwayes He interceedeth for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.) but alſo in a legal and judicial way, as our Advocat, He will plead our cauſe upon the account of full ſatisfaction to juſtice: Though all be of meer mercy, as to us who had nothing to pay, yet, our Surety did pay to the utmoſt farthing what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did require: and thus, having pleaded our right, and obtained a ſentence in our favours, reconciliation being made, and we pronounced juſt and righteous, as being waſhed from our ſins in His blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. Then, 7. He prepareth a room for us in heaven, and maketh all ready for our welcome and entertainment; And thus He is in heaven as our Harbinger, He is gone before to provide and ſpeak for our lodging: No leſs do the words import, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, 3. And knowing that we are expoſed to many dangers by the way, 8. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth the protection of heaven, and a guard to convey us, and to defend us from enemies lying in wait to make a prey of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. And, 9. (that which comprehendeth all) He appeareth before the Throne as an Ambaſſador and publick perſon, in our room and ſtead, to act for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. Or rather (that this His condeſcenſion be not miſtaken) 1. As our head, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. and will He not then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47554:43"/>care for the body? 2. As our Lord and King, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. and will He not be mindfull of His ſubjects and ſervants? 3. As our husband, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and will He have no bowels to wards His ſpouſe, panting in this wilderneſs after her beloved? 4. As a Father, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 9.6. and will He not pity His children? 5. As our elder brother, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. and will not our <hi>Joſeph</hi> deal kindly with us? will He not ſpeak and interceed with the King? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But, (that we may ſpeak to the objection) the infinit knowledge of the divine Nature in the Redeemer is a ſweet ground of conſolation to all that come unto Him; for, thus our bleſſed Mediator muſt know all our wants, whereupon muſt follow an unconceivable communication and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to the humane Nature, to which the divine is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united. So that though the man-Chriſt, be not omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (as ſome Lutheran Divines do imagine) yet He is multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient; and albeit the glaſſe of the Trinity, in which the Saints in glory do ſee here what is done on earth, be a popiſh dream, yet, the humane Nature of Chriſt, being perſonally united to the God-head, doth from thence, by reall communication, receive, and alwayes hath a perfect knowledge of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his members, and of their particular needs and ſtraits: for, as man, He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.) and ſo He muſt know them; yea, while on earth, and in the ſtate of His humiliation, he had ſuch an meaſure of knowledge, that none needed to teſtifie to Him of man; for He knew all men, and what was in man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. But yet, the main pillar of our confidence muſt be, 1. His divine and infinit omniſcience. 2. The pryce he hath payed,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47554:48"/>His ſatisfying the juſtice of God. And thus, 3. the cry of His blood, which doth anſwer every caſe and condition of all the Saints: there is not a petition thou canſt put up, but Chriſts blood doth (and thus himſelf may be ſaid to) joyn with thee, and ſay, <hi>Lord, hearken to that poor ſoul, for whoſe ſake my blood was ſhed; deny not to it what I have purchaſed for it.</hi> And though this voyce and interceſſion be metaphoricall, yet, it is reall and moſt prevailing; though thus rather the Sacrifice then the Prieſt doth interceed, yet, it is the baſis and ground, it is the foundation and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of the prevalency of the other, that proper and formall interceſſion. And thus, Chriſt alwayes, in all caſes, and for every one of his ſervants, doth cry, and God alwayes hearkneth and doth anſwer that cry. The Lord did hear the cry of <hi>Abels</hi> blood from the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10.11. He heard the cry of blood; Of, 1. a mear man, 2. Of a ſinner, (though evangelically righteous) 3.

Yet, the diſciples were no leſſe refreſhed and benefited thereby then if ſeverally he had prayed for every one of them.

O! what a ſtrange inference and connexion muſt there be between our ſining and grieving of him, and his ſympathizing with us and pleading for us? and yet, the Scripture holds out, not only a connexion and compatibility of theſe together, but alſo ſome kind of inference and illation, as if our ſins did move and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with our compaſſionat Saviour to interceed for us; <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocat with the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.

But yet, if any man ſin out of ignorance, frailty, &amp;c. Chriſt pitieth them, he will not deſert their cauſe, he will not juſtifie them in that, nor plead for a liberty for them to ſin; but he will plead for a pardon, and that they may be preſerved from ſin there after. Ah then beware thou abuſe not this mercy and rare priviledge, ſay not we will ſin that Chriſt may pity us, and plead for us: its a ſure ſigne of a graceleſſe ſoul to ſay, let us add ſin to ſin, that grace may abound: how doth the Apoſtle abominat ſuch a vile infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. Though the Lord, to magnifie the riches of his free grace, may make <hi>grace abound where ſin hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Rom.</hi> 5.20. yet if thou wilt cauſe ſin abound, becauſe grace hath abounded, it is an evidence that grace hath not, and (if thou continue in that deſperat reſolution) never ſhall abound to thee; and though Chriſt will plead for ſinners, yet if thou dare ſin that he may plead for thee, thou haſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that thou art none of thoſe for whom he doth, or will plead.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, if Chriſts interceſſion be ſuch a ſure and exquiſite ground of conſolation and confidence, the people of the Jews muſt then have been in a ſad condition, they being deſtitute thereof. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There be two extreams which wee ſhould here ſhun; the one making it begin too early; the other making it too neceſſary, and laying too much weight upon it.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47554:56"/>to the prophets in ſome viſion, doth not import that for that time he did perſonally appear, and did then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for his people, but that according to that eternall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and covenant amongſt the perſons of the Trinity, he was in time to take on him our nature, and in it really to act what then was repreſented: and thus even then he was the Angel of the Covenant by vertue of that eternal tranſaction; and accordingly his diſpenſations did, from time to time, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and in ſome manner repreſent that paction and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and adumbrat what, in due time, he would perſonally do and ſuffer for the Elect; as his appearing, conducting and comforting the ancient people by ſome ſenſible ſignes of his preſence, untill the<note n="(y)" place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> fulneſs of time came, and then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our nature perſonally united to the divine, and in it did really perform what had been formerly only ſhaddowed forth and typified: then he did execute the office of a Prieſt in all it's parts, offering up himſelf in a ſacrifice on earth, and then aſcending into heaven there to appear and interceed for us for ever: And thus we grant that Chriſt did typically and ſymbolically interceed and appear under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not properly and perſonally.

                  <p>There be ſome other expreſſions to the ſame purpoſe here and there intermixed all alongſt that Treatiſe; but, theſe are the moſt material on which he moſt inſiſteth. We do not condemn, but moſt heartily comply with, this great Divine in his deſign, which was to demonſtrat the prevalency of Chriſts interceſſion, and to hold that out as a ſweet cordial to believers in all their fainting fits, and a ſoveraign <hi>Catholicon</hi> to which they may recur for removing and preventing every diſtemper they are ſubject to. O! for a heart to prize, and a tongue to expreſſe that myſtery of love, care and tenderneſs of our glorified Redeemer towards his poor ſervants, wreſtling with many tryals and difficulties in this their pugrimage. O! what bowels of ſympathy and compaſſion are diſcovered by his continual interceſſion for us: and all the texts cited by this Author, and the ſeveral reaſons drawn from thence, do only prove, 1. That Chriſt doth truly and properly interceed for us, that his interceſſion is diſtinct from his oblation and ſacrifice. 2. That his interceſſion muſt prevail, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can deny him nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47554:57"/>And therefore we ſhall not need to make a particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſeveral miſ-applications of theſe Scriptures, for making out what they do not bear. The intelligent reader may, at the firſt view, diſcern this to be the ſcope they aim at, and that they cannot reach the length to which they are drawn by this accurat Diſputer. We ſhall only then in a word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome few conſiderations, which may help to diſcover the fallacy of his inferences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Albeit there be ſo many grounds and reaſons for the ſucceſſe and prevalency of Chriſts interceſſion, yet all of them ſuppoſe his ſuffering and ſatisfying the juſtice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there was an<note n="(b)" place="margin">Whether this impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was moral only and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical, or, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, flowing from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, his juſtice, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we will not now diſpute.</note> impoſſibility lying in the way of the ſalvation and acceptance of ſinners.

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47554:57"/>Yea, 2.

The Goſpel, as it is not oppoſite unto, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of, the natural and morall Law, ſo neither doth it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or diminiſh that obligation, which the Law at its firſt promulgation did lay upon the ſons of men: We are no leſſe then the Jews, lyable to that curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. If we do not obey it in all things; how doth the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21 abominat the Antimonian fancy? <hi>Do we then make void the law through faith, God forbid; yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we eſtabliſh it?</hi> Turks, Pagans, Jews and Chriſtians, Beleevers and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, are all alike under the directive, and mandatory power of the Law: And therefore ſince Prayer is a morall duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the firſt Commandement; and which Pagans by the dark lamp of nature have diſcovered, as flowing from the dictates of the primaevall Law, which God at firſt did write in the heart of man, and doth yet ſo far abide in man, as he is a reaſonable Creature; that though he hath not a Law, yet by nature, he may do the things contained in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. There is yet ſo much light in that old ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe, as to diſcover a Deity, and to point out this ſanctuary and refuge in the time of need; and accordingly the moſt rude and heatheniſh people, have hither run for help in the day of their calamity: What ever in their vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they fancied to be God, to it they made their addreſſe and preſented their ſupplications. So that Antimonians would do well to go to School, and learn of them the truth of this particular. The heathen Mariners, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.5, 6. did prove better caſuiſts; they knew better what courſe to take in that tempeſt, then if they had had thoſe Seducers to have taught them; yea, ſuch Dreamers ſhould have been a greater offence to them then ſleeping <hi>Ionah:</hi> If they thought ſtrange to ſee one man not buſie at prayer in that ſtorm, what would they have thought of him who would have told them, that they ſhould not pray? That they themſelves would do better to ſleep, then to take Gods name in their mouth; I think they ſhould not have caſt lots for finding out the man, for whoſe cauſe that evill was upon them, but the Antimonian, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deliberation, in <hi>Ionah</hi> his ſtead, ſhould have been caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea.</p>

As the moral and natural law doth bind and oblige all men; ſo in every man there is ſome power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for doing and performing what it doth hold out unto him, as his duty: we do not ſay, that men by nature are able to keep any of the commandments in a ſpiritual manner, much leſſe that they can perfectly keep the commandments, but that they can do the thing commanded, they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the external acts, and the ſubſtance of many moral duties; Though, 1. the principle from which, 2.

                     <hi>Aſſer.</hi> 3. As the unregenerat are obliged to do, having gotten ſome light to diſcerne their duty, and ſome power and ability for doing; ſo if they make conſcience of their duty, and honeſtly endeavour to improve the little ſtrength and few talents which they have received, their labour ſhall not be loſt: for albeit gracious habits be not acquired by our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and induſtry, but immediatly infuſed by the Spirit of God (as without our phyſicall concurrence and activity, ſo alſo without any kind of moral-influence and cauſality by way of merit and deſerving on our part) yet by frequenting the Ordinances, (for I do not now ſpeak of thoſe who are without the pale of the viſible Church) and going about du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as we are able, (though we cannot do ſo much as make our ſelves negatively good, and to be without ſin, yet) we may thus become leſſe evil, and not ſo indiſpoſed and unfit for grace; ſome thing of the ſtubborneſſe of the will, and of its averſeneſſe from what is good may be removed, and ſome inclinations (though moral and not gracious) may thus be wrought, begotten and ſtirred up in the heart, and the man (like the ſcribe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.34.) may be brought near to the kingdom of God; and though the Lord be not tied to ſuch previous diſpoſitions, (ſo that he muſt help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work and bring it to perfection when and where theſe are placed, or that he cannot work without ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and previous preparations) yet ordinarly he obſerveth that method, it is his uſual way to help us, when being ſenſible of <hi>the</hi>

                  <p>So that in carrying on of that bleſſed work we may take notice of theſe ſeverall ſteps, 1. God, by the common ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſpirit, doth awaken the ſecure ſleeping ſinner, and lets him ſee his miſery; 2. He diſcovereth to him his duty and the way how he may eſcape and come out of that ſtate; 3. He ſtirreth him up and ſetteth him a work; 4. After that for a while the man hath wearied himſelf in thus wreſtling by his own ſtrength, the Lord humbleth him and layeth him low, and makes him deſpair in himſelf, and ſee that by his doing he cannot help himſelf; and having thus killed; Then, 5. he waketh<note n="(i)" place="margin">Deut. 32.39.</note> alive, and having wounded then he heals, and maketh the ſpirit of bondage a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Spirit of Adoption: and when the poor ſinner is thus, as it were, hopeleſſe and helpleſſe, then he pointeth out to him the braſen ſerpent, that he may look<note n="(k)" place="margin">Iſa. 45.22.</note> to it and live.</p>
                  <p>And thus wee ſee how legal performances and the uſe of the means in the ſtrength received (though it be but litle) riddeth room in the heart, and maketh way to the right embracing and cloſing with Chriſt; In that, 1. it taketh off the heart in great part from vain and ſinfull objects; 2. It keepeth off many temptations; 3. It begetteth ſome deſire and inclination to that which is good and well-pleaſing unto God; which diſpoſition and affection is not over-thrown and removed, but only refined and ſpiritualized in the work of converſion, while ſelfiſh and carnal motives and ends are abandoned, and a new principle of life and motion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and thus the former inclination becometh as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial diſpoſition to the new birth, making the ſubject more ſit and capacious to bring forth, and entertain the man-child; like as dryneſſe in timber diſpoſeth and ſitteth it for the fire, and maketh it combuſtible: ſo that theſe legal performances, the frequenting the Ordinances and pouring out of the ſoul in prayer according to the preſent ability, doth not only, 1. <hi>Negatively</hi> diſpoſe the ſoul for grace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving obſtructions and impediments, and cutting off ſome leaves, yea and branches of ſin, and drawing out ſome ſap
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47554:70"/>from the root; But alſo, 2. poſitively, by begetting theſe poſitive qualifications, which (though purged and rectified) remain after converſion, as ſiccity doth in the tree while it burneth; and laſtly by uſing the means and attending the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, we caſt our ſelves in Chriſts way: and who dare ſay that the compaſſionat Phyſician will not pity the halt and the lame while he goeth by? Certainly ſuch as do caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his way are at a fair venture, Chriſts invitation, yea and command (which all who are under the Goſpel-call have) doth open a large door of hope, and may be lookt on as a ſufficient warrand for ſucceſſe to the obedient: the ſick and diſeaſed had not ſuch an encouragment to come unto him while he was on earth, and yet they would venture, and their labour was not loſt, he healed them all; none were ſent away empty, and many got more then they ſought; they came to have their bodily diſeaſes cured, and he often healed both ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>And thus it may appear, that wicked men ſhould pray, yea and that with ſome ſort of confidence they may draw nigh unto God. We will not now medle with the Jeſuitical and Arminian principles, and two great Aphoriſms, viz. 1. <hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt, Deus non denegat gratiam.</hi> 2. <hi>Deus neminem deſerit niſi prius deſeratur;</hi> i. e. 1.

                     </gap> the King; if then thou wouldſt ask what courſe thou ſhouldſt take that thou mighteſt be ſaved, I would tender thee no better advice then <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, while he was yet in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23, 22. repent of thy wickedneſs and <hi>pray God,</hi> if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
                  <p>And to preſſe this ſo neceſſary advice and exhortation, let us brieflly, by way of motive and encouragement, hold forth ſome grounds, which may ſerve as ſo many arguments to vindicate the point from the Antimonian dream. 1. What ground haſt thou to entertain the leaſt ſcruple, concerning thy duty to pray to God and bemoan thy condition to him, to perform this part of worſhip, which not only thy indigence, but alſo his honour calls for at thy hands; what ſeeſt thou? what do Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold forth unto thee for taking off the tye and obligation, which thy condition and dependance, thy wants and fears, and Gods law written in thy heart and in the Scriptures doth lay upon thee? Can thy former wickedneſs make thee now a Libertine? can it pull out thy ſhoulders from under the yoke? 2. Thou being convinced of thy duty, wilt thou ask whether thou mayeſt perform it or not? There can hardly be a clearer contradiction imagined then, to ſay its my duty to pray, and yet I may not, I ought not to pray; I am infinitly obliged to do, and yet I ſhould not do; for what call ye duty but that which we are obliged to do? Was there ever ſuch a ſubtile notion as to abſtract duty from the obligation to do? Or can there be a more unreaſonable fancy, then to ſay that theſe who are under the means may not uſe them? true it is, that after death the caſe is altered, thou art no more under the means, neither doth the King call and invite thee to come; but yet even then, if he would hold forth the golden Scepter to the damned (as now he doth to the unconverted) they were obliged to draw nigh the Throne. 3. Art thou not convinced that grace is lovely and deſirable? and from whom canſt thou
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47554:73"/>deſire it but from God? and that's to pray; for, what is prayer but an offering up of our deſires to God? 4. For thy warrant thou haſt the command of God, again and again repeated in the Word. 5. Many ſad threatnings denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt kingdoms, families and perſons that will not call upon God. 6. Thou haſt ſeen, heard and mayeſt read of many judgments temporal and ſpiritual, poured out upon ſuch as did not call upon him. 7. We may with the Apoſtle in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. appeal to nature it ſelf; doth it not teach him that is in miſery to cry to him who is able to help and relieve, and to intreat him whom he hath wronged and off nded to pardon and forgive? Thus the light of nature diſcovereth this duty to Pagans, and as with a double cord bindeth it unto thee, who alſo haſt the light of the Word pointing out that way to thy feet. 8. Several talents beſtowed on thee for this effect, do call to thee to improve them: What? haſt thou not ſome natural power and ability to deſire and expreſſe (though not in a ſpititual and ſaving way) thy deſires to God? 9. Doth not thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence draw thee to the Throne? Doth it not accuſe and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge thee, when thou omitteſt this neceſſary and (as I may call it) natural duty? 10. Haſt thou not many wants, fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what do all theſe ſay unto thee, but O! run to the Throne for a ſupply and remedy? 11. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the priviledge, that thou mayeſt approach the great King, doth call upon thee to imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ove it, together with the great benefits which thereby may be purchaſed. Yea, 12. though there were no other income then the preſent effect, which uſually it hath on the heart to enlarge, fit, and in ſome meaſure diſpoſe it for becoming a temple for the holy Ghoſt, and to be a fit room to receive and welcome the King with all his train of attendant graces, which are the harbingers of glory; nay it is not only a diſpoſition, but a beginning of the ſaving work; prayer, if ſerious, is a turning of the heart to God, its a ſpiritual and converting motion of the ſoul, its the firſt breathing of the new creature: deſire of grace (ſay Divines) is grace. Certainly if it be effectual and reſolute, it muſt be ſo; and deſire is the life of prayer, and without it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47554:74"/>there is no prayer, ſo that ſuch as forbid the unregenerate to pray, do diſſwade them to be converted and turn to God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the ſaving work of grace; prayer is not only a <hi>converting ordinance,</hi> but alſo the firſt breathing of the <hi>converted;</hi> not only a mean, but alſo a part and the firſt fruit of <hi>converſion.</hi> 13. The doleful and ſad conſequents, that muſt follow the contempt of this promiſing remedy, the King ere it be long will tear theſe proud rebels in pieces, who would not ſubmit and ſupplicate him for a pardon. 14. The great advantage that may be expected, that probability, if not certainty of ſucceſſe that God will fulfill thy deſire, may as a ſtrong cord draw thee nigh to God; thou haſt not one, but many encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to excite and ſet thee a work 1. Gods bowels opened (in the Ordinances) and his arms ſtretched forth to embrace thee. 2. His call and invitation, his counſel, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, requeſts, expoſtulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with his ſolemn proteſtation, that he delights not in the ſinners ruine, but rather that he would draw nigh to him, that he might live: while the King inviteth the traitor to come and ſeek his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, what ſhould diſcourage him? 3. His Ordinance and appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in making prayer a mean for that end: they who teach that ſinners cannot expect a bleſſing on their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their deſires to God, do ſay (yea though we did abſtract from his fidelity in fulfilling his promiſes) that God hath appointed that Ordinance in vain. 4. His ſtirring up the heart and filling it (though by a common work of the ſpirit) with ſuch deſires and purpoſes as are fit materials of prayer, do ſay, that if we will improve that ſeaſon, the Lord purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to ſend us away empty; he will not be wanting to promove what good he begins to work in us, till we reſiſt his ſpirit and firſt draw off and lye by, and thus ſtifle the new birth in its conception. 5. God's ſatisfying the natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of inanimate creatures, and fulfilling the ſenſual deſires of the brutes and brutiſh requeſts of ſenſual men: when ſelfiſh <hi>Ahabs</hi> have opened their mouths for outward mercies and deliverances, he hath filled them many a time, and caſten ſuch bones to theſe dogs, while they drew nigh their maſters table and looked up to him. 6. The example of others, who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47554:74"/>have followed the like courſe, the ſucceſſe that weary and loaden ſinners have alwaies met with, may be (though thou hadſt no more) encouragement enough for going about this ſweet and promiſing duty: There is none in hell to day, who dare ſay that they took them to this courſe, and conſtantly purſued it with ſuch diligence and enlargement of heart and affections as they might, and according to that meaſure of ſtrength they had, and yet were no better; when they had done what in them lay, they could not help the mater, there was no remedy but they muſt periſh; nay, nay, but their conſciences can teſtifie againſt them, that they were ſlothful and did neglect the means, that they would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their requeſt to God and conſtantly purſue their ſuit, and ſo they did periſh, not in the uſe of the means, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not further uſe the means God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for obtaining of mercy and ſalvation.</p>

                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:47554:93"/>Yet we deny not (and will ye therefore think that we deal more kindly with them, then ſome of their own number) but freely confeſſe, that in Scripture they may find both an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or command, and practices or examples, if they be pleaſed to make uſe of theſe ſince they can find no better; thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9. we have an exhortation to creature-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: But Ah! it was but a temptation ſuggeſted by Sathan. Secondly, for examples, we find <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeking after <hi>Samuel,</hi> and making his addreſſe to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. But Ah! firſt he went to the Witch at <hi>Endor,</hi> and by her enchantments did meet with the ſuppoſed, but not the true <hi>Samuel.</hi> And then, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. the rich man in hell calls to <hi>Abraham:</hi> But he learned that point of Divinity in hell; and what ſucceſſe he found, we may read from <hi>ver.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>As for reaſons; the moſt of theſe they have borrowed from Pagans, a long time after that ancient Chriſtians had ſufficiently anſwered and confuted them. There be only three other grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. the mutual prayers of the living for one another. 2. the pretended miracles in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint-invocation. 3. the honour we ow to them. Of theſe in a word.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt; Though the Saints deſire the prayers of their brethren, they do not pray to them, nor worſhip them; and there be ſeveral reaſons for ſuch a practice. 1. Becauſe the Saints while <hi>in via</hi> and on their journey, are in a praying condition; they pray for themſelves, and why not alſo for their brethren? 2. They may know, and eaſily be acquainted with the tryals and wants of their brethren. 3. They have a command to pray for one another. 4. They have a promiſe of audience and ſucceſſe; and 5. The unqueſtionable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the godly in all ages, for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the performance of this duty. And thus the diſparity between the living and the dead, as to the preſent caſe, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; and therefore we have no ſuch ground to call for the prayers of the dead as of the living.</p>
                  <p>Yet if Papiſts did only plead, that the dead did pray for the living, we ſhould not condemn them upon this account; ſince many reformed Divines do in the general grant this;

Yea, 2. If they did only deſire the prayers of the Saints, as we do of the living, and did not pray to them and worſhip them, though we would pitty them in this their fruitleſſe and unwarrantable labour, while they took pains to ſolicite them, who neither did hear, know, nor take notice of them, yet we could not accuſe them of idolatry and creature worſhip: And this one of them<note n="(x)" place="margin">Crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam ad calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullorum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellendas ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſſe ſi dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum deſiderii eas interpella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri poſſe quod minus habet abſurditatis &amp; divinarum literarum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplis congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>ALbeit no reaſon can be given why that proud King ſhould have appointed, that none, who came unto him without a call, ſhould live, except ſuch to whom he held forth the golden Scepter, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.11. Yet who can doubt, or needs ask a reaſon, why ſtubble ſhould not approach the fire? why we rebells durſt not draw nigh to the provoked King, without his call and invitation; if he did not ſtretch forth the golden Scepter unto us, not only for our ſafety after we come, but alſo to allure us to come, we were in as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a caſe as the devils and damned in hell, and durſt not more then they approach the Throne. But praiſe to his free grace, who hath prevented us with his loving entreaties and raviſhing invitations, and hath given us ſo many large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſucceſſe, that we may draw nigh to him with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. But as thus, we muſt have a warrant to come, ſo for what we ſhould ſay and ask when we come; and the ſole ground both of the one and of the other, muſt be the will of God revealed to us in his Word: We will ſpeak of the firſt in its<note n="(a)" place="margin">Viz. part. <hi>2.</hi> in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of faith, and part. <hi>4.</hi> in the motives to the frequent practice of this duty.</note> own place, but now we muſt only enquire, what is the rule and copy whereby we muſt regulate, and whereunto we muſt conform our ſupplications; and thus in the deſcription of prayer, the object and matter of it is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and limited; we muſt not ask what our carnal will and luſts would crave, but only theſe things that are <hi>agreeable to the will of God:</hi> And thus the will of God muſt be our alone rule and warrant.</p>

                     <hi>will of God</hi> (as to our point) way fall under a threefold conſideration, 1. as it doth import the decrees and eternal purpoſes of God. 2. The commands and precepts; and 3. the promiſes. The Scriptures frequently hold forth all theſe as the will of God, and ſo we muſt ſpeak of them. For albeit the commandments and promiſes, are rather ſigns of Gods will and expreſſions; the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of our duty; and the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the premiſes, of our reward, the one holding out the rule of, the other, a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motive to obedience. Yet they do ſuppoſe, and carry along with them the mind and will of God, not concerning events which muſt come to paſs, but concerning our duty and carriage; they ſhew unto us what God hath appointed us to do, and what would be well-pleaſing and acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and what we may expect from him when we make conſcience of our duty, and are carefull to obey and conform our wayes to his will.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt, the purpoſes and decrees of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the futurition of events, cannot be the rule of prayer: God's determining and appointing that ſuch things ſhall, or ſhall not come to paſſe, cannot be a warrant and rule for us to ask, or not to ask ſuch things. 1. Becauſe the decrees of God are hidden and not known to us, but by their execution, and thus if the decree were a rule, we ſhould not know what to ask till we had received, and then we ſhould praiſe and not petition: it were fooliſh to ask what we have already gotten. 2. There could be no ſinfull omiſſion, and none muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47554:96"/>to do more then he doth; for God not having decreed that he ſhall do, he muſt (according to that opinion) want a rule and warrant for acting and doing, and ſo cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do, but muſt do well in not doing, and become guilty if he did act and do. 3.

For though our ignorance may excuſe and diminiſh our guiltineſs in part, yet it cannot altogether remove it, nor annul that real oppoſition, that is between our prayers and endeavours and the decrees of God. And thus the godly, when they meet with diſappointment, and thus come to ſee that they have had the decree of God againſt them, muſt be in a ſad plight, when they conſider, that all the while they have been fighting and rebelling againſt God in their prayers, endeavours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Thus then the morality of our actions muſt not be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any decree concerning the futurition of events, but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47554:98"/>by ſome other rule, in which muſt concur Gods will and appointment, ſetting bounds unto us, and deſigning our duty, and diſcovering what is well-pleaſing and acceptable to God, honeſt and laudable in it ſelf, and profitable and comfortable to us in the iſſiue; and thus we have the word of God for our direction, and have his laws and teſtimonies to be our rule. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.10, 11, 12, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. <hi>Rom,</hi> 12.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we may take notice of theſe three things as neceſſarily requiſit and concurring in that which is a warrant unto, and rule of our actions and petitions. 1.

Hence we may conceive that Gods laws in Scripture are called <hi>Decrees, Statuts</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> 2.

And that Gods law doth not impoſe an obligation, where there is no kind of promulgation, may be collected from, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.12. where the Apoſtle affirmeth that Pagans, who had not the means for attaining the knowledge of Gods will revealed in the Scriptures, ſhall not be judged by the Scriptures, and that word which they could not know; hence Divines affirm their ignorance of the myſteries of the Goſpel, and their infidelity to be <hi>negative,</hi> and not <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>

As for the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Precepts and Commandments of God, becauſe of the majeſty and ſupream authority of the Law-giver; theſe do not only carry alongſt with them a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for us to conform our wayes thereunto, but alſo lay a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and obligation upon us to obey.</p>

Whatever others may ſee, yet I know no promiſed mercy, that we may not pray for by vertue of a Precept, either particularly expreſſing ſuch a mercy, or comprehending and including it under its object (and generals hold out as ſure a ground for particulars comprehended under them, as if theſe particulars were named) yea, precept and promiſe (as to our caſe eſpecially) go hand in hand, are of equal extent, and cannot be ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24.

                  <p>Yet, 2.

                  <p n="3">3. We would put a difference between general, conſtant and ſtanding, and ſpecial and occaſional promiſes, made to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47554:101"/>ſome one or few perſons, upon ſome particular account and exigence; for theſe ſpecial promiſes cannot be a ground for others to expect or pray for ſuch mercies; yea, nor to them to whom they were made, if the occaſion be paſt or altered; yet when, and ſo long as the promiſe is in force, and ſo long as the ground and occaſion continueth, it is warrant enough to expect and petition ſuch a mercy. Thus <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, that the word of promiſe was warrant and motive enough to him to pray for the eſtabliſhment of his houſe and throne for many generations, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27.25, 26, 29. And as thus, ſpecial promiſes are a ſufficient rule for particular perſons and caſes, ſo general promiſes are general rules to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>But it would be remembred, that ſome promiſes are called general, becauſe they belong to all and every one in their ſeveral places, ſtations, occaſions and exigences; and theſe hold out a general rule and directory to all Chriſtians. Other promiſes are called general, not becauſe they belong to all and every one, but only to all in ſuch a rank, ſtation and condition; thus the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, may pray for the gift of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the Miniſter for a bleſſing upon his miniſtry, and every one according to his place and employment, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar buſineſs or need, may ſeek aſſiſtance, ſucceſſe, direction, deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by vertue of general promiſes made to all in ſuch a rank and condition: And if thy particular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and buſineſs, be not expreſly mentioned in the Word, thou mayeſt have recourſe to general promiſes, as being a ſufficient warrant and encouragement for thee to ask ſuch and ſuch a particular bleſſing. There is room enough, and a blank left in the general word of promiſe, for thee to write in thy name and condition. And ſuch promiſes are as ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for thy prayers, as if thy particular buſineſs and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had been there expreſſed; and thou needeſt not fear to apply them to thee, and then confidently thou mayeſt expect their performance.</p>
                  <p>And thus, 5. In anſwer to the queſtion we affirm, that the promiſe is a ſufficient warrant, to all to whom it belongeth, to pray for the mercy it holdeth forth; and this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47554:101"/>1. from the nature, ſcope and end of the promiſe. For, what is a promiſe, but <hi>an intimation and expreſſion of Gods will, to give good things, and withhold or remove evil from us?</hi> And if ſo, then to deny the promiſe to be a ground and warrant to pray, is in effect to deny, 1. That we may pray the Lord to beſtow theſe mercies he purpoſeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us, 2. That we may deſire from God theſe things we know to be agreeable to his will and for our good. And 3. That the promiſe is an encouragement to duty; for if it encourage us to duty, it muſt carry along with it a warrant for doing, ſince a divine motive (ſuch as Gods promiſe muſt be) muſt be to a good and lawfull end; and therefore, ſince the promiſes are as ſo many motives and encouragements to pray for what is promiſed, they muſt carry along with them a ſufficient ground and warrant for our prayers; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the ſervant of God <hi>David,</hi> no ſooner meets with a promiſe, but he turns it into a prayer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. Where we may take notice of the inference he there maketh, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt promiſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Therefore thy ſervant hath found in his heart to pray.</hi> O might ſome have ſaid, ye are too raſh to run to the Throne, where is your warrant? you have no command. O but (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) have I not Gods Word? He hath ſaid, and promiſed to give, and that's warrant enough for me to ask. Its true, before the word of promiſe came, I had no warrant thus peremptorily and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to ask ſuch a temporal mercy, but now having his Word to build upon, what can devils and men ſay for ſhaking my faith?

As to the ſecond inſtance, we ſhould not ſo much look on the letter, as the meaning and ſcope of theſe words, which is to comfort the godly under their tryals, from the conſideration of Gods powerfull and over-ruling providence,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47554:102"/>who can (notwithſtanding of the power and malice of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) ſo guard and defend (yea, and if it be for the glory of his name and their good, will certainly ſo protect) them, that they ſhall not be able in the leaſt to wrong them; and for ſtrengthning their confidence in God, and that they might the better undervalue the threatning and proud boaſting of vain weak man, the leaſt and moſt inconſiderable injury is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, that enemies ſhall not be able to do ſo much as pull out one hair out of their head; and what is there in this promiſe (though we would only conſider what is directly held forth in the words) that doth not beſeem the prayers of the Saints?

                  <p>Thus we may conclude, that precepts and promiſes are like veins and arteries in the body, they are inſeparable and go hand in hand: the promiſe implying a command (for God did never promiſe to reward our will-worſhip, or to give what we ſhould not ask and pray for) and the command is a promiſe (for he never commanded the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſeek his face in vain) the precept ſheweth unto us what we ſhould <hi>do;</hi> and the promiſe what we may <hi>expect</hi> and ſhall <hi>receive.</hi> The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47554:104"/>Lord in the Covenant firſt and laſt, out of his meer good pleaſure for our encouragement in his work, hath made theſe two reciprocal and relative, our <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>receiving,</hi> our doing our duty and receiving a gracious reward: and thus the commands and the promiſes muſt be no leſſe inſeparable, theſe being nothing elſe but an intimation and declaration of the former two. Its true, God needed not have indented with us for our hire, while he ſent us to work in his vineyard, and we as his creatures had been obliged to obey; but the terms of his Covenant are more ſweet and condeſcending; and now he, who cometh to God in the way of commanded duties, muſt believe that he ſhall not want his reward, <hi>heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Lord with two ſtrong and golden cords, doth draw and bind us to our duty, 1. by his authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 2. by his mercy and free promiſes. And O! what ſutable affections may theſe ſtir up and work in us? the one, reverence and godly fear, and the other, cheerfulneſs, love and confidence. And from this laſt conſideration we may collect, that the promiſes are not only a ſure and infallible, but alſo the moſt proper and direct ground of prayer; for though the precepts be the moſt proper and immediate rule of doing, and ſo of prayer as it <hi>is a duty,</hi> and under that general notion; yet the promiſes are the moſt proper and only ground of prayer, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord's hand is not now ſhortned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work as in the dayes of old, when it ſeemeth good to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47554:109"/>him, he yet worketh wonders in the earth: But, though now it be more rare to meet with ſuch ſigns and wonders, yet, there may be ſuch a ſeries and combination of ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, as may deſerve our ſerious conſideration, and the effect and product may ſeem ſtrange and aſtoniſhing. O! but let us take heed leſt we be deceived by the working of Sathan, that his ſigns and lying wonders beget not in us ſtrong deluſions, and turn us not from the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for ordinary diſpenſations, we have no warrand from the Scriptures, or the practice of the Saints, to lay too much weight on them, or to expect light and direction from them. And as it were a tempting of God to appeal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the event and ſucceſs of our undertakings for their juſtifiableneſs; So it were no leſs raſh and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, fooliſh and dangerous, to be led by invitation from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and to wait for that before we ſet forth. The Lord might juſtly make thee meet with diſappoint ment in the iſſue, when ſucceſs and a ſmiling providence, in the beginning, was the motive that led thee on. If thou wilt not knock till the door be opened, thou mayeſt wait long and ly without, while all within was in readineſs to have welcomed and kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thee; and if thou be too confident in a promiſing opportunity, he may ſend ſome blaſt in thy teeth to make thee ſtrike ſail, and cauſe thy veſſel return to the harbour empty. <hi>Hamans</hi> promotion and moyen with the King did prove a ſtep in his way to the gallows, his advancement made him proud and became an occaſion of his ruine, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 3.5. and 7.10. and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s fetters and impriſonment did lead to his advancement; <hi>Joſeph</hi> muſt be ſold as a ſlave before he be a Father to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and Lord of all his houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Yet, 5. we dare not ſimply condemn the obſervation of the ordinary works of providence, and generally conclude, that no uſe may be made of theſe for light and direction in our way. But, to determine and ſet bounds here, and ſay, <hi>thus far may we go and no further,</hi> and at ſuch a time and occaſion and no other, is no ſmall difficulty, <hi>hoc opus, hic labor eſt;</hi> and knowing none who have gone before us in this enquiry,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47554:110"/>we ſhall take the more heed to our ſteps, and, in modeſty and with ſubmiſſion, offer ſome few particulars, which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a more full diſquiſition by others. 1. Then, although it be certain that we ſhould commend our wayes to God, asking light and direction from him in every buſineſs we put our hands to, that he would hold us (as he did that holy man, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.23, 24.) by the right hand, and guid us by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; yet, we cannot expect an extraordinary revelation, or to hear a voice from heaven pointing out our way. Neither, 2. muſt we imagine, that the Lord will blind-fold our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and violently draw us; But that, 3. he will deal with us in a ſuteable and convenient way, making uſe of congruous means for perſwading and alluring reaſonable creatures to follow, or to reclaim them from ſuch and ſuch wayes and courſes. And thus he doth direct us by ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, or bringing to our memories, ſuch motives and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as will prevail with us, and offering to our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſuch diſpenſations as may have influence upon our judgment, and help us to right purpoſes and reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>And to ſay that we ſhould not thus ponder and improve ſuch works of providence, is in effect, 1. to deny that we ſhould take notice of Gods care, and what our kind Father doth for us. And, 2. to ſay that we ſhould not make uſe of our reaſon, nor lay hold upon what opportunity the Lord doth offer unto us, and thus to give carnal men the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Chriſtians, as to the obſervation and right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of providence: For, though ſuch take little notice of his <hi>band,</hi> yet they obſerve his <hi>work,</hi> and what price he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into <hi>their hands;</hi> and will not be ſo fooliſh as to walk in that<note n="(k)" place="margin">Remember the queſtion is not concerning ſin and duty, but expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency.</note> way they ſee hedged up with thornes, nor to ſlight any promiſing opportunity calling them to enter in at an open door.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. we muſt not lay ſo much weight upon providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial occurrences, as to make them the alone or main guid in our conſultations; for, if there be much lying at the ſtake, a contrary blaſt muſt not hinder us in our courſe: when we muſt buy and the market will not laſt, we ſhould not ſay the day is not fair; and if God called me to go from home, he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47554:110"/>would make the Sun to ſhine upon me. Ah! fool, thy neceſſity doth call thee to go, but the Lord doth not promiſe to bind up the clouds while thou art on the way.</p>
                  <p>Yet, 3. if the Lord, by ſome ſpecial, remarkable or unexpected providence, doth, as it were, croſſe our way, or open a door formerly ſhut, and that after thou haſt been a ſupplicant at the Throne for direction and ſucceſs; thou mayeſt, with ſome cautions, look upon ſuch a diſpenſation as ſent by way of return to thy prayers. If, 1. thou canſt ſay, that thou haſt reſpect to all God's Commandments, and laboureſt to approve thy ſelf to him in thy whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if thou makeſt conſcience of thy wayes, and art not a ſtranger to a ſpiritual and cloſe communion with God, ſo that thou haſt not now gone to him in a fit and good mode, or while thou art in a ſtrait; and as it is thy conſtant courſe to commend thy wayes to him, ſo thou truſteſt and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt on him, and if, while thou art living in a dependance on him, and waiting for an anſwer in a grave and weighty buſineſs that deſerveth thy ſerious conſideration, and much deliberation, he ſend thee ſuch a diſpenſation, thou mayeſt look upon it as a warning and meſſage from the Lord. But, 2. be not too raſh, but wait a while; go to him again and ask his help and aſſiſtance to make a right uſe of that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And, 3. in the mean time thou mayeſt take a view of the motives which may induce thee to undertake ſuch a buſineſs, or may draw thee off; and what may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of the having or wanting ſuch a ſuppoſed mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if in thy inquiry and conſultation, thou findeſt nothing from thence to counter-ballance the impreſſion which that diſpenſation hath made upon thy ſpirit, but rather much to ſecond and concur with it; and thus findeſt the Lord inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to back and carry that work home upon thy heart, and make it as a ſtrong cord to draw thee, who formerly was in ſome ſort of ſuſpence, not knowing what hand to turn thee to, thou mayeſt with ſome confidence ſay, <hi>Now I ſee the Lord making good his word to me, in bringing the blind by a way he knew not, and making darkneſs light before him,</hi> Iſa. 42.16.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47554:111"/>that the dew ſhould be on our fleece, while it is dry upon all the earth; becauſe ſuch a ſign is altogether impertinent, and hath no connexion with the end for which it was ſought, and is of it ſelf miraculous, and ſo may not without an extror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary call and warrant be deſired and ask't; but we did enquire, if it be lawfull to deſire and pray the Lord to make ſome ordinary diſpenſation, having ſome connexion with the preſent buſineſs, a ſign for diſcovering his purpoſe concerning the event of ſuch a buſineſs, and our call to go about it. For <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. None will be ſo raſh as to condeme thoſe holy men, who no doubt in this were directed by ſome extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of the Spirit of God. But, 2. ſince the perſons were eminent and not in an ordinary condition, and directed by a ſpecial (we will not ſay revelation, yet) impulſe and motion, their practice muſt not be look't upon as a general rule and pattern, which we may imitate upon every occaſion. Yet, 3. we dare not ſo limit the ſervants of God as to ſay, that in no caſe they may take ſuch a courſe, and make uſe of thoſe examples, if theſe cautions were obſerved, 1. if the perſon be eminent in holineſs, 2. under ſome great tryal and ſtrait, ſo that the caſe is grave, weighty and intricate, 3. when he findeth a more then ordinary motion and impulſe, ſtirring him up to take that courſe, and pointing out the particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation he is to ſeek for a ſign, 4. that he be not perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his deſire, but ſeeketh ſuch a ſign with ſubmiſſion; ſo that he will not grudge or repine, if he meet not with ſuch a diſpenſation, or if it be given, yet the event doth not anſwer: otherwiſe we muſt tempt God, and limit the holy one, by binding him to a ſign of our chooſing, while we had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to require that diſpenſation, or warrant to ſet it up for a mark, and no promiſe that the event ſhould anſwer it. 5. This muſt not be done, 1. out of pride, as if thou were a none-ſuch, and might expect and ask from God that which others might not. Nor, 2. of curioſity to try the Lord, and put him to it by thy conceit. Neither, 3. out of diffidence, as it were in vain to wait any longer upon God, if he give not ſuch a pledge of his love and care. Neither, 4. out of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or in every trifling buſineſs, but deliberarely, and upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47554:112"/>ſome weighty ground and ſpecial conſideration. Neither, 5. muſt ſuch a one boaſt, and be too confident in that diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he pitched upon for a ſign, though it be given, he ſhould not promiſe too much of it, but patiently wait till he ſee if the event doth anſwer his expectation; and in the mean time, he ſhould beware leaſt his impatience, or vain confidence in that he hath met with, do not intercept and hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. 6. After he hath ſeen the event to anſwer his deſire and expectation, that it may prove a bleſſing, he ſhould, 1. be humble, 2. be thankfull, and, 3. beware that he make not a wrong uſe of this rare diſpenſation, and ſet it not up as a preparative for ordinary caſes, and be not from thence encouraged to follow the like courſe, while he is not placed in the like circumſtances.

And this caſe ſeemeth to be much like the former, there being here a ſign (as it were) ſought from Gods <hi>Word,</hi> as there by his <hi>work;</hi> and ſo obſerving the directions ſet down there, we may make the like uſe of that paſſage of Scripture, which might be made of that diſpenſation: yet (as it would appear) we have a greater liberty here, and we may with leſſe hazard of tempting the Lord, run to his word, then to any of his works; he having appointed the former and not the latter, to be our<note n="(p)" place="margin">Gods works in no ſenſe are a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rule, but his Word is; though not univerſally not properly as to our caſe, it not being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we muſt reflect on the general rules held forth in the Word, in our couſult ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and muſt walk by them.</note> rule (though not properly as to this, yet in another caſe) and there-therefore it would ſeem, that we may more confidently in every caſe run to it for direction, then to the other. Yet here alſo there may be ſeveral miſtakes and errors; as curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, raſhneſs, pride, a miſtake and miſ-application of the Word; ſuperſtition, by laying more weight on that paſſage then it will bear, extending it beyond its light and direction, and looking after ſomething by way of a ſign, in that the Lord hath offered a Word ſutable and pertinent to our caſe. Ah thou ſimple and raſhly confident! know, though that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47554:113"/>Word may ſpeak of caſe much like to thine, and hold out a word which thou wouldſt lay hold on, yet it may hold out no warrant for thee, either to do or not to do, and no ground from which thou mayeſt conjecture concerning the event. But otherwiſe, O! what light, direction, comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement have the ſervants of God met with from ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture, as the Lord in his providence hath occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally offered; from thence they have ſeen and learned what formerly the did not ſee, or not ponder or regard: O! Chriſtian, haſt thou tryed this courſe? doſt thou run to the Word when other counſellors fail thee? and canſt thou not from thine own experience put to a ſeal to this truth? <hi>The Word of God enlightneth the eyes, and maketh wiſe the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.7, 8. Hitherto we have eſpecially ſpoken of a tranſient occaſion, and what uſe may be made of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a right improvement thereof, in reference to ſome particular act or end. Now let us add a word for diſcovering how far providence may be helpfull for conſtituting us into a permanent ſtate and relation; and here we muſt only ſpeak of ſuch a ſtate and condition, as falleth under our choice; for otherwiſe we need not wait for a call, nor enquire after a warrant, we being already determined and placed into ſuch a condition, and ſtanding already under ſuch and ſuch a relation, which obligeth us to the performance of ſuch and ſuch duties; thus we are born children, ſubjects, heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here providence doth conſtitute, and actually and <hi>de facto,</hi> inveſt and place us into ſuch a ſtation, antecedently and previouſly to our deliberation, choice and conſent. But as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe we anſwer, that providence, albeit it may invite, open a door, and offer a fit occaſion for entring into ſuch a place, calling and ſtate as falleth under our election and choice, and where our conſent muſt go before our being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted therein, and ſome qualifications are required, whether moral (as the conſent of, and a call from others who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) or phyſical, as parts, ability and dexterity to diſcharge the ſame aright, though (I ſay) providence may thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, yet it cannot directly, formally, and of its ſelf conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and inſtate us into ſuch a place and condition: But as we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47554:113"/>muſt walk by another rule in the diſcharging of ſuch a place, ſo we muſt another, and better warrant for our entring upon and undertaking of it; thou muſt not invade another mans right, though thou haſt an opportunity offered for doing it ſucceſſfully; neither muſt thou paſſe over that order and method which the Word of God, and the laudable laws and conſtitutions of men have appointed, though thou haſt no competitor, who can lay any claim or plead a right to ſuch a place: But thoſe ſteps being obſerved, providence may be ſubſervient, and in ſome reſpect directive, and ſo far point out thy way, that thou canſt not ſlight that invitation from providence without ſin. But ſtill remember, that providence muſt not go alone, though a providential call be required, yet it is not ſufficient. Providence may open a door, at which, if thou enter in, thou muſt take heed to thy ſteps, leaſt thou daſh thy brains againſt the lintels of that door. Thou muſt have a call both from God and man, from within and without, concurring with the call of providence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou ſhouldſt not hearken to its voice, as if it ſeem to call thee 1. to any place or condition not warrantable and lawfull; 2. without the conſent and concurrence of them by whom thou ſhouldſt enter; 3. contrary to thy inclination, and for the diſcharging of which thou art not qualified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you will ſay, we cannot expect an extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Lord having appointed in his Word, and in the general determined there what ſtations and callings are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and what not, he hath left the particular determination thereof to providence; ſo that we cannot expect to meet with no other call, and thus muſt think, that God by it doth call us to determine and apply the general rules of the Word to ſuch a particular exigence; and finding theſe to agree, we may judge that joint teſtimony to be the voice of God pointing out our way. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If by <hi>providence</hi> be meant all theſe ſteps, we muſt tread in our entry to ſuch a place and ſtation, all the conditions, tranſactions and qualifications which are required, we do not deny, that the call and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of providence, fitting and preparing all theſe requiſites, and opening a door for improvement of them, may ſuffice for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47554:114"/>determining and applying to our caſe the general rules held forth in the Word, and we ſhould look upon it as the call and voice of God, which we ſhould not reject or reſiſt; but if by providence there be not (as uſually there is not) any other thing meant, but a fair opportunity of entring into ſuch a place and ſtation with facility and ſucceſſe, thou mayeſt for thy tryal meet with ſuch an occaſion, which thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not ſet up as a rule, and make it thy warrant, but ſhouldſt rather reſiſt it as a temptation, and turn away from it as a door ſet open to ſin.</p>
                  <p>And albeit he law and appointment of God (manifeſted either in his Word, or by his work on our hearts) be the firſt radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and regulating principle, which ordaineth, authorizeth and appointeth ſuch and ſuch callings, employments and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be amongſt men; yet as to the entrance unto, and the inveſting of ſuch and ſuch perſons, in ſuch particular places and ſtations, a call from man, together with the obſervance of that order and way appointed by man, is neceſſary; yea, it is the very baſis and foundation, and (as it were) formal reaſon, which doth inſtall and conſtitute a perſon into ſuch a place and under ſuch a relation, ſo that now he may and ought (while formerly he might not) diſcharge the ſeveral duties belonging to ſuch a place and ſtation, and flowing from ſuch a relation.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken to this caſe for the moſt part in an abſtract way, having ſeldom made any application to the ſubject mater which occaſioned this enquiry; but it is no difficult work to collect from what hath been ſaid, how we ſhould frame our prayers in reference to providential diſpenſations in ſo far, as we may not make providence a rule of our actions, neither muſt we make it a copy and directory for our ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>Praiſe be to him, who hath not left us to ſuch blind and dumb guides, who neither know nor can point out to us the way. Ah! let us pitty poor Pagans, who have no other Bible but the volum of creation and providence, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſealed ſo, that they cannot open it and read; and often it is blank, and hath not light to impart, or elſe its written in ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47554:114"/>dark characters, that few or none is able to read &amp; underſtand: Though the works of God do ſpeak, yet they often give an uncertain found. But we have that clear and ſure Word of truth for our direction, which we may ſafely follow, and whereupon we may ſecurely reſt. The Sun-light of one ſingle precept or promiſe, is of more uſe for our direction, then the gliſtring of may conſtellations of providence. The night is paſt of us, and though all the ſtare diſappear and hold out no light, yet we on whom the Sun doth ſhine have no cauſe to complain, as if we were leſt in the dark. And as the Word is, 1. a clear, infallible and never-erring rule; ſo its 2. conſtant, perpetual and immovable; we need not fear leaſt the Lord abrogate and diſannul it: but that ſame hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which now holdeth out to us what our hears deſire, may in a moment be lifted up againſt us; that ſame hand that now ſeemeth to open the door, may ſhut it when he pleaſeth, and cruſh thee, if thou ſtand in the way.</p>

The object of the promiſe muſt be ſome good thing, <hi>bonum tibi,</hi> there can be no promiſe made to thee, but it muſt be concerning ſomething which is good and covenient for thee; otherwiſe, it were rather a threatning then a promiſe.</p>
                  <p>O! If all our prayers and deſires were thus limited, and did carry alongſt with them this <hi>proviſo;</hi> we would not be ſo peremptory in our requeſts, nor ſo impatient under a repulſe, nor ſo ready to call in queſtion Gods love and care, and the truth of his promiſes, when in mercy he refuſeth to ſatisfie our luſts and fooliſh deſires. And O! with what confidence, ſecurity and calmneſs of ſpirit might we roll our ſelves, and all our affairs over upon our kind and provident Father? who as he will not withhold what as good, ſo will not ſuffer what is evil to come near us. But as thou mayeſt ask every good, ſo only what is good: for no evil can be an object of love and deſire, but rather of hatred and averſation, and ſo falleth not under a promiſe but a threatning: and thus cannot be a fit material for prayer and ſupplication, but rather for deprecation or imprecation.</p>
                  <p>But here we might ſpeak to this queſtion, whether we may deſire and pray for any evil, whether of ſin or ſuffering, though not abſolutely and for it ſelf, yet as it may be a mean for humbling of us, and drawing us near to God? There be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47554:115"/>few of thoſe we have read who propound, and none who at any length do ſpeak to this material (as we conceive) caſe; but ſince there be ſo many particulars, which we muſt ſpeak to in this Chapter, we ſhall remit this to Part 3. and handle it amongſt the caſes. Only let us from thence ſuppoſe, that the object of our prayers muſt be ſomething that is good, fit, convenient and profitable to us, and that not only reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and in reference to ſuch an end, but alſo abſolutly and of it ſelf, at leaſt negatively and permiſſively. And thus it muſt not be evil, either <hi>morally,</hi> or <hi>phyſically,</hi> it muſt not of it ſelf be either diſhonourable to God and contrary to his law, or afflictive and bitter to us. But as to what is thus good, thou art not ſtraitned either by the promiſe, or the nature of this performance; we have both conjoyned and meeting together in this center, or rather diffuſed through this large circumferene, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Your Father which is in heaven ſhall give</hi> good things <hi>to them that</hi> ask <hi>him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We need not deſcend unto particulars, theſe being ſo many and different; whatever thou ſtands in need of, what ever may be uſeful and profitable either for ſoul or body, for this life or that which is to come, for thy ſtate and calling, for thy preſent exigence and condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou mayeſt ask in prayer, and plead a promiſe for the obtaining of it. All which good and deſirable things, are ſummarily comprehended under ſix heads, in that perfect pattern which our Lord Jeſus taught his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. a commentary and explication whereof, we purpoſe not to offer now, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince that hath been often and fully done by many judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned Divines. But we ſhall reduce what we judged neceſſary to add concerning the object of prayer, into two generals, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons.</hi> Of the firſt, we ſhall ſpeak here, and of the ſecond in the following Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then as to theſe good <hi>things</hi> and mercies, which are the matter of prayer; it would be obſerved, 1. that theſe are either <hi>temporal,</hi> belonging to our bodily and periſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this world, or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> which do<note n="(d)" place="margin">For even theſe temporal things have a remote tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſhould by us be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuch a noble end.</note> more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly concern the ſoul, and our everlaſting being and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

Both ſpiritual and temporal mercies may be ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, for ſome of them are more, ſome leſſe neceſſary for obtaining the aforeſaid ends, as amongſt ſpirituals, ſome are neceſſary for our being and ſpiritual life, others only for our greater comfort, vigor and activity in doing; ſo amongſt temporals, ſome are neceſſary for our bodily being and life, others only for the comfort, better accommodation and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument thereof. And accordingly the promiſes do, and our deſires and prayers ſhould in a different maner reſpect theſe objects.

                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. We need not fear to go to our Father for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all our wants, as well outward and bodily, as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Thus our bleſſed Lord, in that perfect pattern of prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.3. hath taught us to <hi>ask our daily bread;</hi> and <hi>Agur</hi> by his example, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to <hi>pray for food convenient:</hi> and the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us to make our <hi>requeſts known unto God in every thing,</hi> Phil. 4.6. And there be ſo many promiſes concerning theſe outward things, and ſo many inſtances of prayers put up by the Saints, regiſtred in the Word; eſpecially in the book of the Pſalms, that it were not worth the time to inſiſt upon citations; having the conſtant practice of all the Saints, as daily memorials of our duty, and as ſo many torches to ſhew us our way. Yea, this ſeemeth to be one, and not the leaſt of theſe reaſons, why the Lord doth ſubject and expoſe us to ſo many wants and dangers, that we may run to him for a ſupply of our wants, and for protection from the evil we fear; and we ſhould look upon theſe, as ſo many meſſengers ſent to invite us (as the famine did the prodigal) to draw nigh to our Father. We will not now digreſs to confute the old Manicheans, who affirmed, that only theſe temporal and outward things were promiſed in the old Teſtament; with whom in this<note n="(e)" place="margin">

While we ſay that temporalls ought not be abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly askt, we do not affirme our prayers for theſe things ſhould be in that ſenſe conditionall, in which the Logicians do call an enunciation conditionall and hypothetick; becauſe thus the truth<note n="(r)" place="margin">Vera enim eſt haec conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalis Si <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> eſſet Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus eſſet ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationalis.</note> of neither part is conſidered, but only their connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thus doth<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Suppoſitio (ut aiunt) ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ponit.</note> affirm nothing to be exiſting, it doth not import that either the condition is, or ſhall be placed; or that the conſequent, <hi>viz.</hi> what is inferred upon ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or condition, now is, or at any time hereafter ſhall really be. I grant the promiſes concerning theſe outward things may thus be called conditionall; becauſe the condition (either 1. of the expediency of theſe things, 2. of faith and other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47554:122"/>requiſits in our prayer; and, 3. of walking uprightly as to the perſon and ſupplicant) failing, theſe are not included in the promiſe, which is intailed to ſuch a condition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo; and ſo we cannot in faith plead ſuch a promiſe, untill firſt we begg and obtain a pardon. And though there were no ſuch failing, either in the perſon or his performance; either in the ſupplicant or in his ſupplication, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and (according to the tenor of the covenant of grace) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a forfeiture of our right, and exclude us from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; though we may confidently and in faith approach the Throne, knowing aſſuredly that we ſhall have in anſwer to our prayers, either the particular (<hi>viz.</hi> if it be good and expedient) or<note n="(t)" place="margin">See part. <hi>4.</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> elſe the equivalent, ſome other, yea, ſome better thing in ſtead of it, yet we muſt ask with ſubmiſſion as to the particular it ſelf, not knowing whether or not, <hi>hic &amp; nune,</hi> it be good for us, and ſo whether or not the promiſe doth give us a right to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the promiſes are conditional in the former ſenſe, but our prayers are not: For though we ask upon condition, yet poſitively and determinately we ask: for that condition rather reſpects the return, grant and anſwer, then prayer it ſelf; rather our getting and obtaining, then our asking and deſicing: for abſolutely we ask and deſire, but we do not ask and deſire, that we may abſolutely and upon any terms have and receive, but only upon condition, if it be good and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us to have. And thus the condition is rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the object of prayer, then in the act it ſelf. Yet ſince the act doth include a neceſſary habitude to the object, and prayer to the return and anſwer; (for what is it to pray for ſuch and ſuch a particular, but to petition that it may be given to us and we may have it) therefore is it that prayer it ſelf is ſaid to he conditional; which doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not import, that we do not really and properly ask and deſire, but that we do not ask and deſire peremptorily; and that we may have upon any terms; and that we ask with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the divine appointment, and in ſubordination to the one thing that is abſolutely neceſſary. But though we thus determinatly, and (in a maner) abſolutely ask, if we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47554:123"/>reſpect the act and performance it ſelf, yet looking to the whole complex, eſpecially to the grant and return, in the ſuppoſed caſe of non-expediency, equivalently, and by juſt interpretation, we may be ſaid not to ask the particular which we name in our prayers, but rather to ask that we may not have it; while we ask in ſubordination to the great end, we pray that we may not get, that which would obſtruct and hinder our obtaining of it: And therefore ſince the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar we pitched on as convenient for us, is ſuch as would prove a ſnare and a weight to beſet us, while we are running the race that is ſet before us, while we pray for it relatively and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, we pray that we may not have it in the ſuppoſed caſe of oppoſition, as ſhall at greater length be ſhown, Part 4. Here it may be ask't, whether we may alſo pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? and thus pray abſolutely for temporals. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule in the Schools, <hi>An</hi>

                     <hi>hypothetick propoſition when the condition is placed, becometh abſolute.</hi> And thus if the condition be a part of the object, and directly <hi>&amp; in recto,</hi> belong to the mater of the petition, it is placed there, and the petition cannot be ſaid to depend upon it as a condition, and ſo cannot in reſpect of it be called conditional. But not to contend for terms, the queſtion is whether we may pray for the condition, that it may be placed; as for the thing, that it may be given? <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Lord would give ſuch a particular; and, 2. make it a bleſſing. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no doubt that we may ask a bleſſing with all we enjoy, but whether we may ask, that ſuch a thing (of it ſelf indifferent) may become a bleſſing that we may enjoy it, ſeemeth more difficult. For to us, ſuch a petition ſeemeth to import too much eagerneſs and peremptorineſs in our deſire after ſuch a thing; and therefore whatever may be ſaid of this way of asking in it ſelf, as not being ſimply unlawfull; yet it appeareth to be moſt ſafe, either to ask conditionally, or if the condition be alſo askt, and the placing of it be a part of the petition, our ſubmiſſion would then be expreſſed, and we would cordially proteſt, that though we ask ſuch a thing, and that it may prove a bleſſing, yet we will not grudge nor repine though it be withheld, but will acquieſce in the good

But ſince the condition of expediency and ſubſerviency to the great end, muſt belong to the object of our prayers either as a part, or limitation of it; we may enquire, whether alwayes we may reflect upon that condition? and only ask theſe temporals in relation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the one thing neceſſary. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We will not now digreſſe to ſpeak to that noble queſtion, how we ſhould in all our wayes intend and aim at the glory of God? But in anſwer to the preſent queſtion, it will not be denyed that they, who muſt do<note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> all to the glory of God, muſt propoſe this end in that moſt ſpiritual and immediate part of worſhip, wherein we have<note n="(y)" place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> fellowſhip with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; that they, who muſt eat and drink to the glory of God, muſt ask their dayly bread to the glory of God. Its true, the Saints do not in every petition actually and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally reflect upon that great end; yet virtually and by juſt interpretation they do; ſo that if they were askt, if they deſired ſuch a mercy, though it ſhould prove prejudicial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and obſtructive of the glory of God, and a hinderance of their ſalvation; they might truly reply, that they would not in any wiſe have it upon theſe terms, and that they would prefer affliction to ſuch a ſuppoſed mercy: and this <hi>virtual and habitual intention,</hi> muſt exclude all peremptory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient deſires after theſe things; we muſt not ſo forget the chief end, as to make theſe baſe things our end; which we muſt do, when we deſire them ſo abſolutely and peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that we will not bear a denyal: when theſe things are ſought in ſubordination, they muſt alſo be ſought with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as not knowing but they may be hinderances and impediments of that which ſhould be moſt deſired. I do not deny, that thoſe things have a more immediate and direct tendency to another end, as being ſupports and comforts of our bodily and periſhing life; and that they may lawfully be deſired for that end; but life it ſelf, and ſo all the means tending to that end, muſt be referred to an
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47554:124"/>higher end, unleſs we prove ſelfiſh and ſenſual Epicureans. And thus I would rather interpret then exaggerat that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying of Philoſophers and<note n="(z)" place="margin">Yea, <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> goeth a greater length then others, affirming, that outward and indifferent things, ſuch as riches are, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe expetibilia &amp; propter ſe amabilia</hi> And yet <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> will not deny, that there externals are but <hi>bona utilia,</hi> and ſo cannot, as ſuch, be deſired for themſelves, but only becauſe of their uſe.</note> Schoolmen, <hi>that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, health,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are deſirable for themſelves.</hi> I grant that they have ſome intrinſical goodneſs in them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency with us, and agreeableneſs to our natural, yea and rational inclination, and upon that account may be loved and deſired, and ſo may become <hi>fines proximi</hi> and <hi>intermedii,</hi> the mediat and neareſt end of our deſires and endeavours: but, he who will reſt on theſe temporal things (the moſt noble and excellent of them, yea, though they were all united and combined together and laid in one heap) as his ultimat, chief and laſt end, deſerves not the name of a Chriſtian.</p>

                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 6. Not only muſt we ask temporal things, that we may have and enjoy them; but alſo, after we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſe of them, that we may have the right and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe of them: many care not how they have, if they have; not knowing (or not regarding) that they may want a right to what they poſſeſs; and ſo many have reaſon to ask what they have already, to ask a right and intereſt in it through the Covenant of Grace, that it may be added as a pendicle of the Kingdom of God; according to that word of promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32. and that it may come through the channel of a promiſe, and as the purchaſe of his blood, in whom all the promiſes (conerning temporals as well as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals) are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen,</hi> and have their accompliſhment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. We will not here enquire, 1. if theſe temporal and outward things ſhould be askt in the name of Chriſt; but will ſuppoſe that it muſt be ſo from the following Chapter. Nor, 2 will we now digreſs to ask what right unbelievers have to the creatures, albeit a ſentence of condemnation be paſt againſt them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. Yet, as the condemned rebel, by the Kings conceſſion, grant and donation, hath ſome food and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allowed to him till the day of execution come, ſo they, out of the general bounty and forbearance of God, being, for a time, ſpared, have out of that bounty the poſſeſſion of the creatain grant and donation from the great King; ſo that none
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47554:124"/>of their fellow-creatures may queſtion their right and put them from their poſſeſſions: though they, by their rebellion againſt God, have forfeited their right to his creatures; yet, thou mayeſt not, without a licence from the King, (which no Anabaptiſt can produce) ſerze upon the forfeiture. And thus the wicked have not only a <hi>providential</hi> right (as ſome, but moſt improperly do call it; for, though providence may give the poſſeſſion, yet, it cannot give a right; otherwiſe thee vs and robbers might juſtifie their courſe, and plead their title to what they enjoy) but alſo, 2. a <hi>civil</hi> right, ratified by the Law of Nature and Nations, and the municipal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the place where they live: they have a right, 3. of <hi>inheritance,</hi> deſcending unto them from their anceſtors; or, a right, 4. of <hi>purchaſe,</hi> by their labours and induſtry, by bargain, covenant and tranſaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil right will ſtand as firm and valid in humane Courts, as if they were Saints and the holieſt men on earth; but alas! they want a filial and federal right, they being<note n="(a)" place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtrangers from the covenants of Promiſe, and</hi> (notwithſtanding of their Profeſſion) <hi>without God in the world;</hi> and (though they be titular Chriſtians) <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> who is Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and through whom only they can have a ſpiritual right and ſanctified uſe of the creatures; they will only thus become ours, if we be in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. and wo to him, though his poſſeſſions were never ſo great, who doth not hold of Chriſt; who dar meddle with what is his without his leave, he is the great Heir, <hi>he is Heir of all,</hi> and yet how few do acknowledge his right: but, what is ſpoken of riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. may well be ſaid of all that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without Chriſt; <hi>they are and they are not,</hi> as if they were not; they will do no more good then if they were not enjoyed, nay, but much hurt, they are curſed: all will prove a ſnare, his meat in his bowels ſhall be turned into the gall and poiſon of aſps, <hi>Job.</hi> 20.14, 16.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, beſide the having and poſſeſſing of the creatures, we muſt ask, 1. a ſpiritual and federal right unto, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them; a right in him who is Heir of all, and as being the purchaſe of his blood. 2. For a bleſſing to them, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47554:125"/>they may prove helpfull unto us, that our cloaths may give heat, and our meat may feed us. 3. For the ſanctified uſe of them, that they may prove a bleſſing and not a ſnare; that they prove not weights and hindrances; but rather a ſtaff in our hand; that they become not fewel to feed our luſts and weapons of unrighteouſneſs; but rather motives to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and talents wherewith we will trade for the honour of our Lord, and the ſalvation of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>It is true, prayerleſs ones may have and poſſeſſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but only by prayer thou canſt have a ſpiritual right, and the ſanctified uſe of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 5. O then! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever courſe thou take, do not ſlight and neglect prayer; we ſpake of thy warrant, <hi>Conl.</hi> 1. and now for preſſing this exhortation, we ſhall add theſe few particulars. 1. What needeſt thou ſcruple to pray for theſe outward things, though they be not thy portion, and be as nothing in reſpect of the pearl of price and the one thing neceſſary? yet, they are in their own kind and maner<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ne puten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mala, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; bonis: ne putentur maegna vel ſumma bona, dantur &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Itemque auferuntur iſta &amp; bonis ut probentur &amp; malis ut cruclentur, <hi>Auguſt</hi> epiſt. <hi>70.</hi> Bonif. com.</note> good and deſirable, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. they are uſefull, they are ſuteable and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8.

Nature requires them, our vocation, place and condition cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for them: Nay, 3. duty towards God and man doth call to thee to pray for them; for, without them thou canſt not obey the<note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 12.13.

And as the want of them doth thus hinder the performance of ſeveral duties, ſo it is a great temptation to many ſins. O! ſaith <hi>Agur, Let me not have poverty leaſt I ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain.</hi> 5. Go to the Lyons and Ravens and they will teach thee thy duty; they cry to God in their own way; the eyes of all things wait upon him, that he may give them their meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104.21, 27. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145.15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 147.9. They cry with the voice of nature, and will not thou lift up thy ſoul and thy heart to God; indigence mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them groan, and will it not ſend thee to the Throne, and make thee cry to thy Father that he may pity thee? 6. What
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47554:125"/>we get by prayer, hath a heavenly excellency in it; though it were but a morſel of bread, it hath more dignity in it then all the gems and diamonds, and all the imperial Crowns of the world, which come by the hand of a common providence; all theſe things are but the bones without the marrow, <hi>the whole Turkiſh Empire</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi>
                     <note n="(d)" place="margin">Luth. <hi>in</hi> Gen.</note> Luther) <hi>as great as it is, is but a crum which the Maſter of the family caſts to the dogs:</hi> but, be it little or much that is given in return to prayer, it is a bleſſing indeed, and part of the childrens bread: and it's excellency appeareth in theſe particulars. 1. In that it is a ſtream flowing from the pureſt fountain; to wit, the love and good will of our Father; it is a fruit of love, and a ſeal and pledge of love, and as it cometh from love, So, 2. it tendeth to love; it is a coal to enflame our affections and to warm our heart; it is a motive and layeth an engagment on us to love our kind Father, who viſiteth us every morning with his tender mercies: but prayerleſs ſouls take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Gods hand, nor do they much value his love. Hence, 3. it is a mercy indeed, a promiſed and covenanted mercy; as it cometh without that vexation, heart-cutring and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull care, and exceſſive toyl and labour; ſo it is enjoyed with leſs fear, and is free of the ſnares and temptations that otherwiſe uſe to accompany it; <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10.22. It is by prayer that the creatures become good to us, and are ſanctified as to their enjoyment and uſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.45. 4. The right and title of poſſeſſion doth add very much to the worth and goodneſs of things, though not in themſelves, yet as to us who poſſeſſe them: for, 1. Who doth value what a theef, robber, uſurper or oppreſſor doth poſſeſſe? 2. How quickly may he be called to an account, and as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with diſgrace, be ſtripped naked of all? yes, though there were not ſuch hazard of loſing them, yet, an ingenuous ſpirit, yea, a moral Pagan, would rather chuſe a little, to which he hath a right, then thus to enjoy great revenues, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.8. 5. We uſe to judge and eſteem of the worth of things by their price, eſpecially if laid out by a wiſe man and good mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; but every morſel of bread, the meaneſt creature thou
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47554:126"/>getteſt in return to thy prayers, is the purchaſe of blood, it coſt more then a world; though thou wert the greateſt Monarch on earth, by all thy Crowns thou couldſt not purchaſe a right and ſanctified title to the meaneſt of the creatures; ſilver and gold may give poſſeſſion and a civil right, but they cannot give a ſpiritual right unto, and a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of the leaſt crum of bread; and therefore we muſt ask in his name, who hath paid the price and in whoſe blood our mercies muſt be <hi>waſhen,</hi> that they may become <hi>pure</hi> and ſanctified, and may prove bleſſings indeed.</p>
                  <p>O then ! ſince thou canſt not enjoy theſe things in mercy and in love, unleſſe they be given in return to thy prayer, let this be thy way, which is not the way of the men of this world; though it be an eaſie and ſafe way, and though only the right and approven way; but you will ſay, who doth condemn this way? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though few dare with their mouth belch out ſuch atheiſme, yet in their heart, and by their life and practice, too many ſay, O let us rather chuſe any other way, let us imploy our wit, care and induſtry, and if that will not do the turn, let us add falſehood and deceit, and whatſoever courſe elſe, though never ſo unlawfull and unjuſt, yet if it be called our own, and if we by it be thought to help our ſelves, we will rather follow that way then reſt on Gods care and providence; 1. becauſe (think they) if we may enjoy them without God, we may be maſters of them, and diſpoſe of them as we will; we may cut and carve for our ſelves; and like him, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5. enlarge our deſires as hell; 2. Becauſe we dow not away with ſuch preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tenderneſs and circumſpection in our whole converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch zeal and fervency in prayer as is required, and therefore we rather work and toyl a week, then pray half an hour; we rather ſweat at our calling, then take ſuch heed to our ſteps: We know not, we are not acquaint with, we love not, and cannot endure that way, but we know our buſineſs, and like our work, and when its done its done, and we are at reſt; but if we get any thing by prayer, our work is but as it were to begin, we muſt yet watch over our hearts and wayes, and take heed how we uſe and employ what we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47554:126"/>have gotten; we muſt return the ſacrifice of praiſe to God for his bounty in giving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle had reaſon to exhort us, <hi>That in every thing, by prayer, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and thanks giving, we ſhould make our requeſts known unto God,</hi> Phil. 4.6. Not as if the Apoſtle, and we now, while we are preſſing this neceſſary, though much ſlighted duty would have you enlarge your deſires after theſe things, or be too ſolicitous about them, and peremptory in your requeſts and prayers for them. No, no, if our zeal be ſpent that way (as alas too often it is) that will marre the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our prayers, and bring down a curſe rather then a bleſſing; but the end and ſcope of this exhortation is, that we would live in a conſtant dependance upon God, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him our ſelves and all our affairs; begging his bleſſing on all our wayes and endeavours; and that whatever we get and enjoy, be it little be it much, it may prove a bleſſing, and may be given in mercy and in love; that we may have the ſanctified uſe of all we enjoy, and grace to improve it to the honour of his name, and for promoving the work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>O then ! art thou called a Chriſtian? and if thou be not an atheiſt and worldling, whatever pains and diligence thou art at, let this be the main, from which thou expecteſt more then from thy riſing early and going late to bed; whatever care and labour may want ſucceſſe, and prove to no purpoſe, yet thou ſhalt never ſeek his face in vain. He hath ſaid, he will not ſend the praying ſoul away empty; and will he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? O then let us ſay, we would rather have a little this way, then all the riches and honours imaginable without the bleſſing; rather let us have none of theſe things with the love of God, then never ſo much in wrath. Have we little or much, or nothing with the bleſſing, we are happy; and all the work without this will prove but a curſe and a ſnare <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a gift and no gift. Ah Sirs ! all of us would have, and when would we ſay its enough? But O ! how few are they who take the right courſe, and run to the right foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Whether would you trade with your own ſtock or not? whether do you expect more by your prayers, or your
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47554:127"/>labour and induſtry? and whether would you rather receive from God, or by the work of your own hands? canſt thou ſay, that thou dependeſt upon God and will be content with his allowance, and reſolveſt to improve what he giveth, to the honour of his name; if this be thy purpoſe and deſire, then haſt thou little, or haſt thou much, it is a bleſſing; thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is good, and beſt for thee; thou haſt, and thou ſhalt have more untill thou be ſatisfied, when the immortal crown ſhall be put upon thy head.</p>

One thing is certain, this is the right way and method, and if we follow on and do not draw back, we ſhall meet with mercy. There is none in hell who
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47554:130"/>dare ſay that they took this courſe and conſtantly followed it, and yet were no better; but, their conſcience can tell them that they did ſoon weary and fell off, that they were negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and that they thus periſhed not in the uſe of the means, but through their negligence: though the Lord hath not bound himſelf by any promiſe, yet, he will be ſo far out of the reach of any ſuch challenge, that none ſhall be able to ſay, we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed becauſe we muſt periſh; though we had the Goſpel preached to us, yet it could do us no good.</p>
                  <p>But, (that we may not digreſs) it is certain, and none can deny it, that if thou hold on in that way, thou <hi>mayeſt</hi> meet with mercy, and if, with the dog, thou return to thy vomit, thou <hi>muſt</hi> periſh; and though thou haſt no more but a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,</hi> a <hi>who knows,</hi> and a <hi>may be,</hi> the Lord will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; that is ſome comfort and encouragment, and warrant and ground enough for thee to venture and follow that courſe: others have had no more, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Joel,</hi> 2.14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Amos,</hi> 5.15. and their labour hath not been in vain, <hi>Jonah,</hi> 3.9, 10. thou wilt ſeek no more for thy encouragment in things that concern thy bodily life and eſtate; wilt thou not ſend for the Phyſician, unleſſe thou be aſſured his pains will be ſucceſsfull? wilt thou not ſow, unleſs thou be aſſured thou ſhalt have a plentifull harveſt? and not go to ſea, unleſs thou know that thou wilt return ſafe?

And then, 2. ſince unbelievers have not faith, they cannot pray in faith, and ſo thus cannot pray abſolutely for faith: but, ſome will yet ſay, though believers be not the object to which thoſe promiſes belong, yet, the Elect, and all the Elect, have an intereſt in them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Yet, the Elect, before their converſion, cannot in faith (which they have not as yet) plead theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſo they cannot be ſaid to pray abſolutely for what is held forth in theſe promiſes; and therefore the conſideration of their election muſt be impertinent for clearing the preſent queſtion. But, 2. I cannot ſee in what propriety of ſpeech, or according to what ground or reaſon the abſoluteneſs of the promiſes, or of our petitions can be explained by this kind of univerſality; and what light can be brought from thence for determining this controverſie.</p>
                  <p>You will then ſay, but what call you an abſolute promiſe? For <hi>anſ.</hi> we would diſtinguiſh between the promiſe, and the object of the promiſe; not the object to which, but whereabout it is converſant, <hi>viz.</hi> the thing promiſed: albeit it be groſs to confound theſe two, yet the preſent debate appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be occaſioned in great part by that miſtake, 1 then as to the promiſe it ſelfe, that muſt be accounted abſolute which (as to the performance of it) doth not depend upon any condition required on our part, and thus an abſolute promiſe is oppoſed to a conditionall promiſe, and ſo theſe which we called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Grace</hi> muſt be abſolute, becauſe they do not ſuppoſe any gracious diſpoſion in the ſubject that they may have their accompliſhment. And theſe which we called <hi>promiſes to grace</hi> muſt be conditionall, becauſe they require and ſuppoſe ſome qualification and condition on our part, that they may be performed to us: but then, 2. the thing promiſed may be ſaid to be abſolute, not becauſe it abſtracteth from any condition to be performed by us; but becauſe it abſtracteth from the circumſtances of perſon, time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to its goodneſſe, and conveniency, and that it may be the object of a promiſe: and this kind of abſoluteneſſe muſt be meaſured in reference to the promiſe it ſelfe, and not in reference to the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its performance and accompliſhment: and ſuch a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47554:133"/>thing may be ſaid to be <hi>abſolutely</hi> promiſed, becauſe it doth not depend upon any other thing that it may become a fit mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of a Divine promiſe, and a fit object for our prayers, and deſires; that it doth not borrow its goodneſſe from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, nor depend upon any extrinſecall and variable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, nor upon any end, for the obtaining of which it may be conducible; ſo that it is intrinſecally, and of it ſelfe, and thus abſolutely, and indiſpenſably good and deſireable: and thus, ſuch a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>abſolutely promiſed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>abſolutely good,</hi> albeit the performance of ſuch a promiſe depend upon ſome condition and qualification in him to whom the promiſe is made; and ſuch a promiſe may thus <hi>viz. objectively</hi> be called abſolute: and thus grace with every degree and further meaſure of it, both as to its being and graduall perfection, may be ſaid to be abſolutly promiſed; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit upon another conſideration, and if we have reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way and manner of performance, grace it ſelf may be ſaid to be abſolutely promiſed, and the encreaſe of it condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally.</p>
                  <p>But you will then ſay, ſince the promiſe is the rule of prayer, and the meaſure of grace may be ſaid to be conditionally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, why ſhould it not alſo be conditionally askt and prayed for? <hi>Anſ.</hi> As we have ſhown in what ſenſe the promiſe may be ſaid to be abſolute, ſo we ſhall now, in anſwer to the queſtion, ſhow, 1. What it is to pray abſolutely. 2. In what ſenſe the promiſe muſt be acknowledged the rule of prayer. As to the firſt, we are ſaid to pray abſolutely for any mercy, not becauſe the promiſe (whereupon our prayer is grounded) as to it's performance, doth exclude all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or that we expect an anſwer without any conſideration of him who prayeth; not regarding any fitneſſe, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in him to receive, what he asketh: for thus, none of the Saints could be ſaid to ask any thing abſolutely; not the immortal Crown; for that will only be given to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, to him that overcometh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not the encreaſe of grace, for that is only promiſed to him that is faithfull in a little; and grace, as to it's being and exiſtence, is not promiſed to believers, (for, to them the promiſe is already accompliſhed) but to the
<pb facs="tcp:47554:134"/>unconverted elect; and thoſe with whom we have now to deal do maintain, that only grace it ſelf is abſolutely promiſed, which cannot, according to their hypotheſes, be askt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe the unconverted (to whom only ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes do belong) cannot pray in faith, nor lay claim to any promiſe, ſo long as they continue in that ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Then to pray abſolutely for any mercy, muſt be nothing elſe but to pray for it, 1. abſtracting from all proviſo's and conditions of expediency, or ſubſerviency to ſuch or ſuch an end; 2. abſtracting from all circumſtances of perſon, time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which it doth depend, and from which it doth, as it were, borrow its goodneſs; and thus to pray for it as a thing intrinſecally, abſolutely, univerſally and indiſpenſably good, at all times, and to all perſons; And, 3. to be ſo peremptory in our deſires after it, that we will not compone, nor bargain for any other thing in lieu of it: And thus we ſhould pray abſolutely for grace, and for its growth and encreaſe. Who knoweth the worth of the leaſt meaſure and degree of it? all the gold and rubies of the earth are not worthy to be laid in the ballance with it; who can ſet a price on it, and appoint the equivalent? it is of more worth and excellency, then that a compenſation may be made for it: Thus we may not upon any terms ſell or tranſact; only we muſt ſubmit, and (upon the conſiderations forthwith to be named) acquieſce in that meaſure the Lord ſhall aſſign to every one.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, how ſhould our prayers as to the preſent caſe be conform to the promiſes: for anſwer, we offer theſe few diſtinctions; 1. we would diſtinguiſh between prayer it ſelf, and the return and anſwer of prayer. Hence, 2. we ſhould diſtinguiſh between the preſenting or offering up of our deſires and our expecting or waiting for an anſwer. 3. Let us diſtinguiſh between a ſimple deſire (though never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and fervent) becauſe of the goodneſs and amiablneſs of the object, and a confident deſire grounded upon a Divine promiſe. 4. Let us diſtinguiſh between the promiſe abſtractly and formally conſidered, and the object of the promiſe. Hence theſe concluſions in anſwer to the queſtion.</p>

But, 3. Though I deny not, that many Chriſtians, who are very diligent in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties and attending the ordinances, continue ſtill weak, and are left in a mourning and comfortleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; yet it may perhaps be queſtioned, 1. whether ſuch do perform the condition? becauſe there may be much hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, ſelf-ſeeking, pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus, 2.

And, 3. The promiſe may be fulfilled and thou not diſcern,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47554:135"/>ſome miſt and darkneſs may ſo obnebulat the ayr, and ſome film overſpread thine eyes, that thou canſt not ſee, and art not fit to judge of the ſtate and condition of thy ſoul: what though thou findeſt not ſuch enlargement in duties, ſuch a meaſure of aſſurance and joy, as others, yet thou mayeſt have more grace, and a greater ſtock, thou mayeſt ſpread at the root, in humility, ſelf-denyal, love, deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though thou ſendeſt not forth ſuch branches of comfort, peace, and ſuch melting of affections under ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus, though thy fruit be not ſo ſenſible, yet it may be as real and ſolid, as if thy tree did fairly bloſſome: And as ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation may flow from the good pleaſure of God, who will not have all the walkers to Zion to tread the ſame ſteps, nor have the ſame proviſion by the way; ſo from our ſelves, and from thy natural melancholick temper, and the temptations of Sathan fitted to thy inclination and natural infirmity; and thus there may be much unquietneſs, many fears and ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and much ſtirring of corruption where there is much grace; So that it is a difficult task to judge rightly here, and to paſſe a ſentence concerning the meaſure of our graces, when we grow, and when we decay in grace: But the beſt rule to judge by, is our zeal for God and againſt ſin, and our activity and diligence in the work of the Lord: And not our comforts and enlargements, or melting of affections, by which too many judge and paſſe a wrong ſentence. Thus it is hard to judge of our ſelves; but as for others, as we cannot diſcern and infallibly know, who have performed the condition, who not, ſo we can hardly conjecture to whom the promiſe hath been fulfilled, to whom not.</p>
                  <p>Yet, 4. If at any time they, who could plead the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition, might complain that the promiſes were not performed to them, ſuch a diſpenſation ought not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be a denyal, but rather a delay, a ſuſpenſion and not a perpertual withholding; ere it be long there will be a compenſation made, and ſuch ſhall not be loſers in the day of reckoning; for then (ſuppoſing there ſhall be different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory) his crown ſhall be no leſſe<note n="(n)" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note> weighty and reſplendent, then if here he bed received and improven thoſe

But all this is a fruit, not of grace, but of corruption: Grace is a ſhield, which being improven, would ward off and prevent ſuch abuſes; its a fountain, that alwayes yields ſweet and wholſome waters; it is a principle, whoſe act, are only and alwayes good; though thoſe ſpiders within us, can extract poyſon out of the moſt excellent oyntment, and can make grace an object mater, and (as it were) occaſion of ſin, to which of it ſelf it is ſo much oppoſit: And if upon this account, we may not pray abſolutely for a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of grace, neither muſt we pray abſolutely for grace, as to its eſſence, nor for that<note n="(t)" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.9.</note> ſeed, and the habits and principles of our ſpiritual life, for theſe alſo may be thus<note n="(u)" place="margin">Nullum eſt in hâe vitâ bonum quo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo proſua li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertate non poſſit malè uti aliquo modo, <hi>Suar,</hi> ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra cap. <hi>17.</hi> ſect. <hi>9.</hi>

Then the true and compleat reaſon, why temporals ſhould not be abſolutely askt, is, becauſe they having no moral and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal goodneſs in them, nor any formal, direct and immediate tendency and reference to our happineſs, may prove, and often have proven impediments and hinderances of hapineſs, and occaſions of eternal ruin; therefore, they ſhould only be askt conditionally and relatively; that though they have a natural goodneſs in them, and are fit to nouriſh, refreſh and comfort this bodily life, yea, and to be (as learning, parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) civil ornaments and qualifications of the whole outward man, and thus become bleſſings, when they are ſanctified in the uſe yet ſince they have no ſpiritual goodneſs in them, and are ſo ready to be abuſed, we muſt only ask them as helps, and when, and ſo far only, as they may be ſubſervient unto our ſpiritual and eternal good. But ſpiritual things as ſuch, and becauſe they have a neceſſary and immediat tendency to that great end, they may and ought to be abſolutely askt: And it were a degrading and diſparaging of grace, to deſire and petition it with a limitation, condition or exception; 1. the things themſelves being ſo excellent, ſo intrinſecally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly good; 2. ſo good and uſefull to us, and for our happineſs; and, 3. ſo conform to the will of God, and ſo ſubſervient to his honour: What can we then imagine for counterballancing ſo great goodneſs? And what condition can there be added for warranting us to diſpence with ſo much goodneſſe? and to part with ſuch a price which may bring ſo much honour to God and happineſſe to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, The abuſe of grace and ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, is meerly accidental, and ſolely from our ſelves, no occaſion, nor invitation being offered from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but on the contrary, their ſole inclination and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47554:138"/>is towards the right work, and to keep our feet in a right path; but as for temporals, they being of themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as to the right and wrong uſe of them, and they (eſpecially the abundance or exceſſe of them) being fit baits to our luſts, and thus of themſelves, as it were, occaſions and temptations to ſin; we muſt not be abſolute and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in our deſires after them; the condition of expediency muſt alwayes be expreſſed or included; as we muſt be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the uſe of them, ſo we muſt be ſubmiſſive in our deſiring of them.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, there is ſome hazard, from whatſoever fountain it flow, whether from our ſelves, or from the object; and ſhould we not guard againſt that in our prayers? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet not ſo, as to pray conditionally for theſe excellent and neceſſary things, otherwiſe we may ask nothing abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: becauſe (as we have ſaid) the beſt and moſt neceſſary things, may be abuſed by our corruption, we muſt then abſolutely and peremptorily ask, and with the thing it ſelf ask the right uſe and improvement of it: And here it is not difficult to determine the<note n="(x)" place="margin">

                  <p>Yet I do not deny, that we ſhould ſubmit unto, and carry our ſelves patiently under the want of ſuch and ſuch a meaſure of grace; 1. as it is our own loſſe and miſery; 2. in that our Lord will allow us no more proviſion for our journey, nor intruſt us with a greater ſtock; and 3. in that the different diſpenſation of grace, as to its meaſure and gradual perfection, may ſerve (though in a way unknown to us) to proclaim the wiſdom and glory of God, his power, and the freeneſs of his grace; its our part in humility to adore the depths of his counſel, and in ſilence ſubmit to all his diſpenſations towards us; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if thereby his glory might be promoved: <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32.

And if Chriſt joyn with us, we need not fear leaſt our prayers be rejected. And thus, I would interpret thoſe reverent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47554:147"/>Divines, who ſeem to limit their prayers to the Elect, that they make mention of their election, not as if they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all others, who belong not thereunto, from their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but to teſtifie that ſpecial obligation that lyeth upon them to pray for the Elect; albeit it cannot be denied, that we may put up ſome particular petitions for the Elect; and thus we may well add ſuch a limitation, though we muſt not alwayes and altogether exclude others who are not of that numbee.</p>
                  <p>But, it may be askt whether we may follow that form of words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and as the Lord there is ſaid to be the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that believe; So we may pray for ſalvation to all men, adding, that we do ſeek that eſpecially to believers. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Albeit thus we do not formally pray for reprobats, and under that reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet, this form of prayer ſeemeth to border too near thereunto, and it hath thus much in it, <hi>Lord, though ſuch be reprobats, I will pray for their ſalvation:</hi> and thus, as it were, in a compounded ſenſe, we pray for reprobats, and though not as they are reprobats and under that reduplication; yet, although they be reprobats, we ſay thus, that we do pray for them; were it not better to abſtract from the decree, and not mention it at all? 2. That form of words cannot be our pattern; becauſe God is there ſaid to be the Saviour of all men and of believers, <hi>reſpectu diverſorum objectorum;</hi> he is not, <hi>ad idem,</hi> the Saviour of believers and unbelievers; for, the one receiveth only an outward, bodily and temporal protection, the other a ſpiritual and eternal ſalvation; while as the queſtion doth ſuppoſe, that the object is the ſame, and that the difference is only as to the maner, meaſure and degree; for, how can we be ſaid to petition any thing, <hi>rather</hi> and <hi>eſpecially</hi> for ſome beyond others, unleſs we petition the ſame thing both to the one and the other? But, 3. if the object were the ſame, and no incapacity ſuppoſed or included into ſuch a note of preference.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47554:147"/>either the further degree of our affection towards them, and deſiring good things to them, or that we deſire a greater meaſure of theſe things unto them then unto others.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we proceed to ſhew, that notwithſtanding we had a revelation concerning the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſome particular perſons; yet, we might lawfully pray for them; albeit that general command to pray for all men did not oblige us: the promiſe (which is the main mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) being removed, and an infallible intimation being made, that no ſucceſs can be gotten thereby, it can be no more uſed as a mean, and we will not find that any where it is enjoyned as a meer duty: and it is probable, that the ſole ground why that command is relaxed, as to thoſe who have ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt, is, <hi>becauſe there</hi>

And thus, when we compare the general relaxation with this ſpecial obligation, the reſult will be this, that when we look to the decree of God, and conſider, that our prayers will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, we may forbear to offer up ſuch a vain (as to the good of ſuch a perſon) oblation; and yet, when we look upon the miſerable ſtate of ſuch a perſon, eſpecially if ſtanding under ſome near relation to him, we may pity him, and may poure our complaint in his behalf to the Lord.

                  <p>And I would ask, if the Lord did intimat his decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and that he would never ſhew mercy to ſuch a man, might not, and ought not ſuch a one, notwithſtanding of that revealed decree, pray for mercy, and uſe the means whereby he might eſcape the wrath of the Almighty? You will ſay, it may be queſtioned if any man were obliged to look upon ſuch a revelation as holding out a peremptoty and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable ſentence, and not rather as a threatning, implying a proviſo and condition, and a virtual promiſe of mercy upon repentance, ſince all the promiſes and threatnings of the word, though as to the letter they appear to be moſt abſolute and peremptory; yet, admit a ſuteable condition, limitation and exception, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13, 14, 15.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47554:149"/>may we not alſo pray for others, whatever be the decree of God concerning their everlaſting eſtate? I grant there is ſome difference, we being far more neceſſarily and indiſpenſably bound to our great maſter and Lord, then to our fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; there is nothing can be imagined ſo long as he giveth us leave to work in his vine-yard, and caſteth us not out, that can liberat us from that duty we ow to him, the ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being eſſentiall, the bond and ty muſt be indiſſolvable; but love being the meaſure, and as it were rule of our duty to men, when we know our labour will be in vain, though we may in teſtimony of our love appear for them, yet we will hardly find a ground whereupon to build an obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and therefore a revealed decree, though it doth not make our endeavours for the good of our brethren unlawfull, yet it may liberat us of that obligation under which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we did ly; it muſt alwayes be our duty to pray for our ſelves, but to pray for others only then when we can look upon our prayers as a <hi>mean</hi> for their good.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, if it be not our duty, then we muſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogat, and walk without rule when we pray for theſe whom we know to be in a hopeleſſe condition. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit there ariſe no obligation from the generall command to pray for all, (which is the rule that falleth under the preſent diſquiſition) yet there may ſo much obligation ariſe from other grounds, as may warrant our practice, and will have the force of a Law to him who is preſt to act upon ſuch a motive. Thus our Divines, diſputing againſt the Popiſh ſupererogation, do maintain, that what they call evangelical counſels, hath the ſtrength of a law, when ſome ſpeciall circumſtances do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, invite, yea and engage him, who obſolutely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from ſuch a ſtate and condition is not obliged ſo to act; thus ſaith<note n="(h)" place="margin">

Though the Lord did reveal to Parents and Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that their Children and people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, yet its hard to affirm, that they might not pray for their ſalvation; not as if they might pray the Lord to alter his decrees; but abſtracting from theſe, though revealed to them, that they might intreat that the object of that decree might be altered, and that their dear relations might be taken out of a ſtare (not of reprobation, from which we do ſuppoſe they do abſtract, but out of a ſtate) of ſin and miſery, and put into a ſtate of grace and happineſs; and though ſome from thence might infer, that they thus prayed the Lord to change his eternal purpoſe, yet as they ſhould abſtract from the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, ſo from ſuch a conſequence and conſequent, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pray for that to our near intereſts, which in it ſelf, and to them is good and deſirable: Thus we ſhould rather play the part of a <hi>Metaphyſician,</hi> then <hi>Logician.</hi> And that we may make ſuch a kind of Theological abſtraction, ſeemeth to be certain, from what hath been ſaid, <hi>Art.</hi> 1. And the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſequence is as valid in the caſe of <hi>Peters</hi> avouching and adhereing to his maſter, as in this caſe; for <hi>Peters</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al was revealed unto him: yea, the ſame argument may as well be framed againſt Chriſt his praying, that the cup might paſſe from him, while he knew that it was decreed that he ſhould drink it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, though a prohibition were added to a revealed decree, yet it would appear from the practice of eminent Saints, that our hands were not bound up; for albeit the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47554:150"/>Lord had revealed to <hi>Samuel</hi> his purpoſe to reject <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11, 26. adding a prohibition upon the account that he was rejected, not to pray any more for him, <hi>Ch.</hi> 16.1. yet it would appear, that this reſtraint was rather a relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the command, and a permiſſion granted to <hi>Samuel</hi> not to pray any more for <hi>Saul</hi> (though his King) then a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory prohibition; for albeit <hi>Samuel</hi> came no more to ſee <hi>Saul</hi> till the day of his death, yet he left not off to mourn, (and who can imagine then that he left off to pray?) for <hi>Saul, Ch.</hi> 15, 35. So the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> though he knew that the Lord had purpoſed to caſt that people out of his ſight, and thereupon had received, as would appear, a peremptory prohibition to pray no more for them, <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16. yet forbeareth not to pray for them; though the Lord had told him that he would not hear him, though he did cry, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. yet he would cry, until he met with a ſecond prohibition, having the former reaſon annexed to it, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11.14. yea, he would not yet ceaſe, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is renewed the third time, <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.11.12, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all theſe prohibitions, he ſtill prayeth, as it would appear from the reſt of that propheſie, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a ſupplicant for Iſrael untill the day of his death, the book of the Lamentations clearly ſhew. Thus alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> continues to pray for a ſtubborn people, after the Lord had ſaid to him, <hi>Let me alone,</hi> Exod. 32.10. A prohibition ſeemeth to have more in it then a revealed decree, and yet it did not bind; <hi>Moſes, Samuel</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> would not be driven from the Throne, though by both theſe cords they were pulled back, and yet I hope none will be ſo uncharitable, as to think that theſe holy men did ſin in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond part of the queſtion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is in great part cleared by what hath been already ſaid. Mr.<note n="(i)" place="margin">Burgeſſ <hi>ou</hi> Joh. 17. <hi>ſerm.</hi> 41.</note>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47554:150"/>in the Court may not interceed for a vile malefactor, yet a ſpecial Favorite may interpoſe: And this ſpecial priviledge of eminent Chriſtians to interceed for them, for whom others need not appear, ſeemeth to be intimated, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Joh,</hi> though they would not have prevailed for thoſe there mentioned, yet in that they are there named, their moyen with God is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implyed; which gloſſe the learned <hi>Burgeſs</hi> doth reject, thinking the prohibition to be general; but we, becauſe we conceive that there is held forth there no peremptory prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and though, <hi>Moſes, Samuel,</hi> &amp;c. might prevail more with the Lord then others (which is the thing there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) yet we know no petition they were allowed to put up for any, which others might not as well preſent unto the Lord; all Chriſtians of whatſoever ſize, having the ſame rule, and being under the ſame commands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others, as <hi>Lyra</hi> think, that though we may not pray for ſuch as have committed that ſin, that they may eſcape eternal puniſhment, yet we may pray, that in part they would leave off<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                  <p>But the words being general, <hi>not to pray,</hi> they muſt either hold out a general prohibition, or no <hi>prohibition</hi> at all, but a <hi>relaxation</hi> of the general command, and a general <hi>permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to all not to pray for ſuch; and if we do more narrowly ponder the words, we will find that they hold out no prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; for ſaith the Apoſtle in that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16. <hi>there is a ſin unto death</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47554:151"/>not, <hi>ye ſhall not pray,</hi> the note of negation doth not exclude the performance of that heavenly exerciſe, but it removes the command; and thus notwithſtanding of what is there ſaid, we may out of zeal to the glory of God in the ſalvation of ſuch a one, and becauſe of ſome particular relation to him, wiſh and pray for his ſalvation, abſtracting from the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and his peremptory threatning never to ſhew mercy to ſuch a one: It ſeemeth to be a cruel and monſtrous thing, to lay the hand on the mouth of a parent or child, of a paſtour or maſter of family, and to ſay they may not wiſh, deſire and pray for the ſalvation of their ſeveral relations, though their condition were never ſo hopeleſſe and deſperate: How pathetically did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> deſire and pray, that Iſrael might be ſaved, notwithſtanding they knew that Gods decree did ſtand in the way, and that many of them (as we may from ſeveral grounds collect, and from Chriſts Sermon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. from 25. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 23. from 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neceſſarily conclude) were guilty of that blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Then, 2.

                  <p>You will ſay, may we not pray againſt ſuch as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that unpardonable ſin? Thus the Chriſtians of old prayed againſt <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, if then we may pray for

It is true, 1. theſe who are guilty of the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall never find grace to turn and repent, and lay hold on Chriſt, and ſo ſhall never be pardoned; yet, if they did turn they ſhould find mercy and live. And then, 2. albeit there be no particular ſin that is unpardonable, except that blaſphemy; yet, the moſt part of ſins and ſinners ſhall never be pardoned, and therefore
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47554:152"/>our prayers can do them no good: and thus, unleſs we limit our prayers to the Elect, and add this condition when we pray for others, <hi>if they belong to the election of God,</hi> we muſt pray for them whom our prayers will not profit.

If we abſtract from theſe extraordinary caſes, (<hi>viz.</hi> of a revealed decree concerning the reprobation of ſome particular perſons, and the certain knowledge that this or that perſon, hath committed the unpardonable ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt) we may univerſally affirm that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pray for all men, though never ſo wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, according to the exhortation, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.1. I know there are not a few judicious Divines who think that the Apoſtle here doth not exhort to pray univerſally for all and every one, <hi>pro ſingulis generum,</hi> but for all indeſinitly, for men of all ranks and degrees <hi>pro generibus ſingulorum;</hi> not for every individuall man, but for every rank of men, for rich poor, noble, ignoble, Jew, Gentile, &amp;c. and they add this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe Arminians from that place compared with <hi>v.</hi> 6. do draw an argument for univerſal redemption.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47554:155"/>the land of the living, becauſe the goodneſſe of God extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all men, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.10. when he cometh to ſpeak of ſalvation and happineſſe, he propoundeth a diſtinction, denying that we may pray, that all and every one <hi>collectively</hi> ſhould be ſaved, becauſe (ſaith he) we know from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that all ſhall not be ſaved, and yet (ſaith he) we may pray for every one ſeverally, <hi>pro ſingulis ſpeciatim;</hi> becauſe in charity we are obliged to hope the beſt of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man.</p>

                  <p>Hence, 2.

We know not (whatever may be our fears) that the Lord will not ſhew mercy to this preſent generation, that now the Lord will not fulfill that promſe (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.8.) to give to Chriſt the heathen for an inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion, that now in thir laſt dayes, the Lord will not accompliſh that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.1, 2. and eſtabliſh the mountain of his houſe in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and exalt it above the hills, and make all nations flow unto it; who knoweth when that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. ſhall be made good? <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. If all nations may embrace and profeſſe the Goſpel (and many Divines from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propheſies of the Scripture labour to prove, that thus it ſhall be, and none can deny that it may be) then I would ask why we may not pray for this bleſſing unto them? that all the earth may hear the joyfull ſound, and welcome the glad tidings of ſalvation; and <hi>that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25, 26. and from that Text, we may further argue thus, That which we ſhould propoſe as our end in teaching, exhorting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be a fit object of our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the recovery of ſinners is the end of the miniſtry, of exhortation, doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore we may and ought pray, that our Miniſtry may have this bleſſed effect.

                  <p>Ye will (no doubt) be ready to complain, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpeaketh not home to your condition, that you hear the Word, but are little better of all you hear, the Word preacht is unſavory, and O! will ſome (who think they are ſome body) ſay, If I were living under a more ſearching and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſtry.

The Saints have few friends, but many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Sathan and the world do rage, and will ye ſtand by? they deſire and expect your help, and will you diſappoint them? you are the favourits of heaven, ye have the Kings ear, and will you not improve your moyen for the good of poor Saints? ſhall your friends, who expect your help, be forgotten? will ye prove ſo unfaithfull and ſo unkind, and will ye thus by your negligence betray that truſt that is lying upon you, and not improve that price that is put in your hand? you may be inſtruments of much good to others, and will you defraud them of what they may expect, yea, and what as debt ye ow to them? (Gods command to you to pray for them, is their bond whereby you are become their debters) and which notwithſtanding they are ready to pay you again in kind, and in your own coyn: and ye need not be afraid, that the maſter will upbraid you for pleading for them, they will not prove ungrate, and make their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies weapons of unrighteouſneſs; and your prayers, as they may prove inſtrumental for the obtaining, ſo for the right improvement of their mercies.

Who would not mock a Traytor, who ſhould undertake to go to Court and plead for others? and what King would ſuffer himſelf to be thus abuſed? and what a return might ſuch as imployed rebells to interceed for them expect? but if the rebell will lay down his arms and ſubmit to the King, if he will beg pardon for his former rebellion, and make his peace, others may be heard, while they interceed for favour to be ſhewed to him, and in proceſs of time, he may get the Kings ear, and have moyen to plead and prevail for others.</p>

               <p>ALbeit every act of worſhip and adoration muſt <hi>ulti mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> be terminated in God, and be equally directed to all the perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, as its chief and principal <hi>object,</hi> and therefore in prayer (as a main point of divine worſhip) we muſt draw nigh to God, and offer up our deſires to the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, as having one and the ſame divine nature, power and glory; yet in this ſpiritual performance (as alſo in every other ordinance) there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as it were, proper and peculiar to each perſon of the Trinity; as we ſhall more fully ſhew, <hi>Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where we are to enquire, how we ſhould conceive of God in prayer, and after what order we ſhould direct our petitions to each of theſe glorious perſons? But now, in a word, we take notice how the Apoſtle expreſſeth this appropriation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. where we are ſaid <hi>through Chriſt to have acceſs to the Father by the Spirit;</hi> 1. The holy Ghoſt dictates and draws up our bill; 2. The Son gets us acceſs and audience, he preſents and pleads our cauſe; and, 3. The Father accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and granteth our requeſts; which being thus framed by the Spirit, and perfumed with Chriſts incenſe, muſt be a<note n="(a)" place="margin">Phil. 4.18.</note> ſacrifice acceptable, and well-pleaſing odour of a ſweet ſmell to God. We will not now ask, why we are ſaid to have <hi>acceſs to the Father,</hi> while we muſt alſo approach the Son and holy Ghoſt; but remitting that to its own place, we ſhall now, for clearing the deſcription of prayer, only ſhow, 1. what it is to pray through Chriſt or in his name; 2. what it is to pray by the holy Ghoſt, and what is the help and aſſiſtance he affordeth: of the firſt, in this; and of the ſecond, in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:47554:174"/>Time was, when there was a ſweet communion between God and man, and that was mans happineſſe; he needed not have been afraid to approach the Throne; but ſin did make a wofull breach and ſeparation, and ever ſince the apoſtat rebel hath lien under a twofold incapacity to draw near to the King; 1. <hi>Morall,</hi> in reſpect of guiltineſſe and provocation; the wrath and terrours of the provoked majeſtie, like that flaming ſword, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. doth guard the way, and hold off the rebel, that he may not approach the Throne; fear did not keep man from ſining and departing from God, therefore fear ſhall arreſt him in the place that he dar not return; 2. <hi>Phyſicall,</hi> in reſpect of weakneſſe and impotency, and that not meerly <hi>privative,</hi> but accompanied with a <hi>poſitive</hi> enimity, ſtubbornneſſe and averſeneſſe from returning Man by his fall did not only break his leggs, and ſo diſ-enable himſelf, that from that time forth he had no ſtrength to aſcend to the place from which he fell; but alſo, like ſome vagabonds who having reſolved to make a tread of begging, rejoyce in their impotency and ſores, and refuſe to be healed; ſo the wretched ſinner accounts his loſſe gain, and rejoyceth to wallow in the mire into which he hath fallen, hating God, and abhorring a communion with him, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider nor lay to heart his own miſery and unhappineſs.</p>
               <p>But while no Phyſician was employed, nor could be found to cure this deſperat diſeaſe and ſoul-lethargy, our bleſſed Saviour was<note n="(b)" place="margin">Iſa. 65.1.</note>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47554:175"/>none was able to give God a ranſom for it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 49.7, 8. He gave his precious ſoul an offering for our ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. When none could cure our ſores, he made a plaſter of his own blood, he did bear our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſment of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5.</p>
               <p>And now all honor and praiſe be to our phyſician, who hath cured all our ſores, and hath removed both that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and phyſicall incapac ty and impotency, of which we did labor; He hath, 1. by his blood waſhen away the guilt, ſo that now there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; Secondly, by his Spirit (whoſe<note n="(h)" place="margin">Gal. 4, 5.6.

Thirdly, he hath purchaſed liberty and acceſſe, and now <hi>by his blood we have boldneſſe to enter into the Holieſt by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us; Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. Fourthly, he hath purchaſed to us ſucceſs and a ſafe return of our prayers; ſo that the Father now can deny us nothing we ask in his name. <hi>John.</hi> 16.23.</p>

               <p>I have proceeded further in this argument then I intended, but I hope it will not be unacceptable to the reader who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to know ſomething of the grounds and judgment of the learned concerning this intricat queſtion; we ſhall now only 1. point out ſome ſcriptures, from which ſome judicious divines have, and not without probability might collect, that if not the whole body of the Jewiſh church, yet ſome who were more eminent for knowledge and holineſſe, did pray in Chriſt's name; 2. we will propound a diſtinction; and 3. obviat an objection.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, theſe and ſuch like expreſſions ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat that the ancient people of God did tender up their ſupplications in the name of the Mediator; as 1, while they ask of God <hi>for his names ſake, Pſa.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 79.9. if we look on <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. where Gods name is ſaid to be in the angel which did conduct the Iſraelites, (which angel was the<note n="(n)" place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> meſſenger of the covenant, the promiſed <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>) may we not conceive that while they deſired to be heard, for the name of God, they askt for his ſake in whom Gods name (ſaith<note n="(o)" place="margin">

                  <hi>ſake,</hi> as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 132.10. did they not rely on him of whom David was a type? would they run to the ſhadow and neglect the ſubſtance? eſpecially ſince the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> once and again is called David, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Eze.</hi> 34.23, 24. the truth going under the name of the type; why may we not think that they rather lookt after the typified David, then him who only was the type and figure? 5. while they prayed the Lord to hear <hi>for his own ſake;</hi> thus the Lord promiſeth, (and they accordingly might have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) to defend Jeruſalem, 2 <hi>King</hi> 19.34. where by way of explication is added, <hi>and for my ſervant Davids ſake.</hi> viz. for him whom David did typifie: thus alſo we have that ſame phraſe expounded, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. and may not he be ſaid to be the Fathers own, <hi>Who is the brightneſſe of his glory and the expreſs image of his perſon? Heb.</hi> 1.3.6. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hath his recourſe to him as his cautioner and <hi>undertaker,</hi> and David runs to him as his <hi>Surety, Iſa.</hi> 38.14. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.122.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what ever truth may be in ſuch a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon theſe places, yet none of them do expreſſly and convincingly hold out the point. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It cannot be imagined that the Jewes who did ſee Chriſt afar off, and whoſe light in compariſon of ours was but darkneſſe, ſhould ſpeak ſo diſtinctly and expreſsly of Chriſt, as we who live in the dayes of the Goſpel; 2. As of ſermons, ſo of prayers, for the moſt part we have only ſome brief notes ſet down in the Scriptures; and therefore we may not conclude what was not ſpoken, from what is not written: ſo that if we would know how the ancient people of God did tender up their worſhip to him, whether in the name of a Mediator or not; it ſeemeth a ſurer and better way to ſurvey all the Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſpeak of his perſon and offices, then to confine
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47554:185"/>our inquiry to theſe few and brief parcells of prayers recorded there. But ſince ſo much weight is laid upon an expreſſe text, let us look on <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 17. Where the Prophet prayeth thus, <hi>O! our God, hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Sanctuary that is deſolat, for the Lords ſake.</hi> After which manner, and in the ſame words, we Chriſtians to this day uſe to pray, while we expreſſe our dependence upon the merit and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our bleſſed Saviour, and why ſhould we conceive that <hi>Daniel</hi> uſing the ſame words did not expreſs the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>Albeit there be, 1. thus ſo many ſeveral expreſſions in the prayers of the ancient people, which may have relation to Chriſt; yea, 2. though there be ſo many clear predictions of his Incarnation, Paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, 3. although ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Beleevers, might expreſly offer up their prayers in his name, yet for ordinary, and as to the body of Beleevers (we need not ſpeak of the rude and carnall multitude, who reſted on their outward oblations, and lookt no further then ſenſe could reach.) We think with<note n="(q)" place="margin">

               <p>And that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. (which may be objected againſt their praying in the name of Chriſt) doth only ſerve to clear this diſtinction; for it may be ſuppoſed, that Chriſt there doth not ſimply deny that his Apoſtles had askt any thing in his name; could theſe, who knew him to be the Saviour of of the world, draw near to God in any part of worſhip not relying on him? but he denieth that directly, expreſly and by name they had askt any thing for his ſake, although after the former maner of worſhip they had askt in his name; <hi>viz.</hi> virtually, implicitly under types and ſhadows.

                  <hi>Cajetan</hi> calleth that maner of invocation, (<hi>viz.</hi> expreſly in his name) which he preſcribed to his diſciples a little before his death, and to all the true Iſraelits to the end of the world, <hi>notum orandi modum.</hi> But though the main ſcope of that place be to hold out theſe two different wayes of asking in his name; the one formerly followed, the other now preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it may rationally be thought, that our Lord there doth alſo upbraid them for living too much by ſenſe, and that being too much taken up with his bodily preſence, they had too much neglected the ſpirituall improvment of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory office. Albeit it ſeem hard to think that the honeſt ſervants of God did not ſome one way or other look to the Mediator in all their performances, as being typified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by all their ſacrifices, ſacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, according to their meaſure of faith and light, they did more or leſſe rely upon his name, and notwithſtanding of that rich opportunity the Apoſtles had for encreaſing their knowledge and faith, yet its certain, that before their maſter was taken from them, they had attained but to a ſmall meaſure of both.</p>
               <p>But that we may be ſaid truly and really to ask in Chriſts name, when the habituall intention of our heart doth reſt on him; albeit we do not actually think on him, and ſo cannot mention his name, is manifeſt from the many petitions in our prayers, to which his name is not annexed, (I know none who uſeth, neither is it needfull thus at every petition to mention his glorious Name.) and yet none will once queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all theſe petitions may be thus preſented in his Name, yea and no leſſe then theſe other deſires expreſly offered in his Name: its true we uſe to cloſe our prayers in his Name, profeſsing that we ask all for his ſake, but before that clauſe be added, were not (I would ask) the ſeverall petitions put up in faith? otherwiſe, how could they be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table?</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the application, there is a queſtion may be here propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> whether we ſhould ask temporall and bodily things in the name of Chriſt? for it will not be denied that Spiritualls, which have ſuch a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto, and connexion with eternall Salvation (whereof

               <p n="1">1. We, in <hi>Adam,</hi> by our manifold actual rebellions, did forfeit our right to all the creatures, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a ſanctified right and title to them, but in him who is the<note n="(t)" place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>heir of all things:</hi> but all are ours if we be Chriſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. and therefore, in teſtimony of our dependance on him, and our acknowledgment of his purchaſe and right, we muſt ask all in his name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the promiſes (of<note n="(u)" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.8.</note> this life, as well as of that which is to come) in him, are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen,</hi> in him they were made, and in him they have their accompliſhment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. How then can we plead any promiſe but in his Name; and without a promiſe we have no warrant to ask, and cannot ask in faith: Nay, I would ask, in whoſe name do we ask if not in Chriſts Name? What can be the title or claim we can pretend, if we be not in him, and ask not for his ſake? <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is;</hi> and muſt not that flow from his blood who is our righteouſneſs and ſanctification? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Our inherent holineſs cannot give us a right to the promiſe, though it be an evidence and fruit of our being in him, who hath purchaſed for us a right to all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our bleſſed Lord, in that pattern which he preſcribed to his diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. did teach them to ask temporals, comprehending all thoſe ſynecdochically under <hi>our daily

               <p n="4">4. What we may not ask in faith we ſhould not ask at all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. But our faith can have no rock to ſtay on but the name of Chriſt: if we come not to this living ſtone we cannot offer up an acceptable ſacrifice to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. and faith muſt be toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21.</p>

Theſe outward things being of themſelves indifferent, they become inſtruments and weapons either of ſin or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and therefore, that they may become bleſſings indeed, and ſanctified in the uſe, they muſt be askt in his name who is the fountain, and whoſe Spirit is the efficient of all our ſanctification, and the right improving of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>

               <p>But what that vail is, which the Lord hath drawn over the heart, to hide and cover it from Sathans eye, and what that bull-work is, which the Lord hath reared up to hold off that enemy, ſo that he cannot enter, nor thruſt in any of his fiery darts without a licence and permiſſion, is, I confeſs, not eaſie to determine or explain; ſenſe cannot reach, nor reaſon fully diſcover it, and we have no revelation here to direct us. But though we cannot particularly diſcover what that covert (which no creature can remove, pierce, or look thorough) is, and wherein it conſiſteth; yet it would appear, that there is ſome poſitive obſtacle and impediment, which hindreth Angels from beholding an object of it ſelf intelligible, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to their underſtanding (for if our thoughts and purpoſes did exceed their cognoſcitive faculty, they could not know then when that vail is removed, and there could be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and ſociety amongſt Angels and ſpirits.) only this much we may ſay, that albeit the bodily eye hath <hi>potentiam viſivam,</hi> ſo that of it ſelf, it is ſufficiently qualified for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and beholding colours. Yet, 1. it muſt be directed towards, and applyed to look upon the object; otherwiſe it cannot ſee it: ſo the Angels, when they do not reflect upon and look into our heart, cannot ſee and know what is there.

Yea, 3. If the Lord

Sathan can well bear that ſome few, and for a ſhort while, be very zealous and active for the Lord, and diligent and frequent in duties, if thereby he can beget a prejudice in the hearts of men againſt Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and can make them think that Chriſts burthen were like the<note n="(n)" place="margin">Mat. 23.4.

               <p n="3">3. Sathan may move us to be frequent in prayer, and to wait upon the publick ordinances moſt punctually, that thereby he may either ſtop and ſilence the conſciences, and that thus we may commit ſin with the greater freedom and boldneſs, or elſe (as in groſs hypocrits) that this may be a cloak and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, a mask and cover to hide our wicked deſigns and wayes from the eyes of others, that ſo we may be able to do them the more miſchief, and to ſin with the leſs ſuſpicion and hazard. Thus the hypocritical Phariſees, that they might with the more ſecurity devours widows houſes, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence made long prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. And <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that he might cover his conſpiracy and treaſon, will go and pay his vow in <hi>Hebron,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.7.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47554:211"/>hand may appear when ſinners become ſo mad, as to think not only to hide cheir wickedneſs from men by thoſe outward performances, but alſo thereby to purchaſe a liberty from the Lord; and thus, as it were, to hire and bribe him, as they do their own conſciences, to be ſilent; as that impudent woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>I have this day</hi> (ſaith ſhe to the fooliſh youth whom ſhe enticed to whordom) <hi>payed my vows, and I have peace-offerings with me, therefore came I forth to meet thee.</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, I have payed old debt, and by my ſacrifices purchaſed a liberty for us to do wickedly, we need not fear, I have moyen for time to come.

               <p n="4">4. Sathan may come and ſtir us up to religious exerciſes, that thereby he may add fewel to our pride. Thus Phariſees of old, and ſuperſtitious Papiſts to this day, in their madneſs and exceeding zeal (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his perſecuting the Church of Chriſt calls it) are helped of Sathan; they meet with fire from hell to kindle their affections in their unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable performances; and though their work upon the matter were good and commendable, yet Sathan will not draw back his hand, if thereby he can puffe them up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in them an opinion of their own worth, and that by their good works they are juſtified and merit heaven. <hi>This perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cometh not of him that calleth you,</hi> Gal. 5.8. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that by your works ye are juſtified (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) cometh not from God, who calleth you to the kingdom of his dear Son, but from him, who thereby labours to make Chriſt of none effect unto you (<hi>v.</hi> 24.) and to drive you to hell. We need not then ask, why many Papiſts are ſo eminent for works of Charity and liberality, and ſo frequent in their dead, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and carnall way of worſhip, ſince Sathan will be ready to fill the ſails with wind, when the veſſel is loaden with proviſion to feed our ambition and pride; but if that current be once ſtopt, and a trade rightly carried on for eternity, he will raiſe what ſtorms he can, and ſend out many pyrats, either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let none miſtake, as if hereby a pretence were miniſtred unto the lazineſs, ſtoth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of ſuch as are in the right way; certainly the zeal, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and diligence of thoſe who are without, ſhall ſtop thy mouth, and make thee inexcuſable in the great day, if thou thus reſt upon an orthodox profeſſion; and if thou be in Chriſt and art led by his Spirit,<note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> Stronger is he who is in thee, then he who is in the world, thou haſt another kind of help and aſſiſtance for doing good then others: O then, let thy work be anſwerable.</p>
               <p>If in any good motion, we can diſcern one or moe of thoſe wicked deſigns, we may be jealous leaſt Sathan have a hand in it, and ſhould guard againſt his devices; which, when eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may ſerve as ſo many marks and characters, whereby we may know the print of his foot, though he be diſguiſed, appearing in white rayment.

They would go out of their own ſphere and exerciſe the miniſterial Function; wherefore the Lord juſtly puniſhed both the one and the other. It was good and a commanded duty to offer ſacrifice, but it did not belong to <hi>Sauls</hi> office; it was fit that ſupplication ſhould be made to the Lord, but it belonged not to <hi>Saul</hi> to do it in a publick and miniſterial way, (as it would appear <hi>Saul</hi> then did, <hi>v.</hi> 12) it was neceſſary that incenſe ſhould be burnt before the Lord, but it did not appertain to <hi>

A heart acted by the Spirit can, with <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 131.1. ſay, when he maketh his ſupplication to God, <hi>O Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great maters, or in things too high for me.</hi> The Lord will have all things done decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in order, and is not the author of confuſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.43. and as he leadeth not his children out of the way, So neither doth he bring them to dark and unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable paths: it is not from him that weak Chriſtians, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe of the female Sex, do meddle and vex themſelves with dark queſtions and intricat diſputes; or, that the moſt ſtrong and learned do dive too curiouſly in things not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the ſecrets of the Almighty. He knoweth that to be an unprofitable task and too high for us, and will not have ſuch new wine put into our old bottels, (till they be renewed) leſt they break, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.17.5. Sathan, as a cruel exacter, may preſs thee to deal inhumanely and too rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47554:213"/>either towards thy ſelf or others; and though ſuch a work may ſeem to have much piety and zeal in it; yet, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than doth blow the bellows, Thus, if tender Chriſtians ſhould find a mighty impulſe upon their ſpirits, to pray and faſt ſo long and ſo frequently as to hazard their health, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect their calling and not provide for their family, (ah! how rare a caſe is this? but though multitudes do ſpare and pamper their bodies, to the neglect and ruine of their ſoul; yet ſome have failed on the other hand, and then certainly) Sathan is not idle; it is he that helpeth forward this cruel zeal. Thus he ſtirred up the Jews (in<note n="(x)" place="margin">But the command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him was only for trial; there being a ram provided for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Gen. 22.13.</hi> but they could pretend no kind of command, <hi>Jer. 7.31.</hi> Nay, the Lord will rather have no ſacrifice then a work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould be omitted, (far more then cruelty ſhould be exerciſed) <hi>Mat. 11.7.</hi>

Thus alſo he moved <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts to cut themſelves with knives and lancets till the blood guſhed out, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.28. Thus alſo he driveth blind Papiſts to afflict and ſcourge themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet, this ſort of cruelty is far more tolerable then the fury of Anabaptiſts and other Sectaries, who are mercifull to themſelves, but mad againſt all others; in their zeal for God, they could embrue their hands in their neighbours blood, and cut off all others that they might enjoy their poſſeſſions, that they might live as Kings, there being no man to ſay to them,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Eccl. 8.4.</note> What do ye? 6. Sathan moves tumultuouſly and confuſedly; holy motions having no dependance one upon another, and tending to diſtract the heart in the preſent work, (whether that be prayer, hearing the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) muſt come from him who likes not the work, and who laboureth by all means (and that his hand may not be diſcerned, maketh choice of the moſt fair and ſpecious, as being at ſuch a ſeaſon moſt probable) to mar the work in hand: but the Lord prepareth, ſtrengthueth, fixeth and enlargeth the heart, and inclineth it to perform His Statutes, and eſtabliſheth our goings, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will not raiſe, but rather expell thoſe

Sathan will ſuggeſt and ſtir us up to good, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and partially; Sathan, when he moveth us to do good being out of his own element, his motion cannot be equal and uniform, if to ſome good, not to all: yea, to ſome for this very purpoſe, that we may be ſtayed from following ſome other, haply of more concernment. However, he knoweth, that he who is guilty of offending in one point, is guilty of all, and that God will accept of none of our works, unleſs we have reſpect to all His commandments, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he can ſet one table of the Law, or any one command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt another, he will not withdraw his help for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling thee to bear that part of the burthen thou haſt choſen.

But there are others (and theſe not a few) who place all their Religion in the duties of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and they have no other charter to happineſs but that they are good neighbours; they deal juſtly, they wrong no man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Sathan may foſter their deluſion, he will allow them to be very ſtrict and exact in their carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men: Ah! what a monſtrous kind of Religion muſt that be [to wrong men in nothing, and to rob God of all his ſervice and worſhip, (except perhaps ſome outward performances without life and heat) to give to man all his due, and to God none of his?].

But thus we ſee, that Sathan dealeth with the Saints, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Task-maſters once dealt with the Iſraelites, who urged them to work and make brick, but would allow them no ſtraw or materials for the work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.6, 7.

No doubt the Publican was then enlarged, when he durſt not look up to heaven, and while he looked in to himſelf, ſaw nothing but ſin; haply he had parts and great poſſeſſions, ſome name and place amongſt men, and muſt he not be deſigned by theſe? nay, but whether he had any conſiderable portion of theſe worldly excellencies, we know not, he regardeth not, they were not worthy once to be mentioned; but his name, expreſſing all that he could ſay of himſelf, was this, <hi>a ſinner,</hi> Luk. 18.13.

Theſe two are inſeparably conjoyned, and both mutually concur here, the one helping to clear the other, and both joyntly the point in hand; the more we ſee our own vileneſs and miſery, we will love and prize Chriſt the more. And therefore we may ſuſpect every diſcovery of our own emptineſs, as being only moral and philoſophical, if it do not enlarge the heart towards Chriſt, and ſend us out to his fulneſs; and on the contrary, all our pretended love to Chriſt, and preſumptuous cloſing with him, which doth not flow from conviction, deſpair and ſelf-denyal, is a meer deluſion, <hi>Mark,</hi> 8.38.

If thou get a ſight of thine own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if thy aſſiſtance in duty doth not puff thee up, but rather maketh thee more humble and vile in thine own eyes, thou wilt return to God the ſacrifice of praiſe for his goodneſs towards thee; if thou be ſenſible of thine own weakneſs and inability, thou wilt render to God the glory of all thine enlargements and actings: what cometh from God, leadeth in to him; but what floweth from nature, is coafined within its own orbe, and will not look ſo high: As water in the pipe can

               <p>But, 2. their taſte is ſuperficial and ſlight, in compariſon of that which the converted find; it is not meat to them, it maketh them not grow; they taſte ſpiritual things, as cooks do the meat which they dreſs for others; they could not live upon what they thus eat, but muſt have their meals beſide; or rather as they who ſerve at the table, they find the ſmell of the meat but eat none of it; though ſome ordinary diſh may be left for them, yet they muſt have nothing of the more delicat portion: So the unconverted may get ſomething of the portion that is ſet on the childrens table, and find, as it were, a ſmell of the heavenly and ſpiritual gifts, which may ſo affect them as if they did eat, and is therefore called a <hi>taſte,</hi> but yet nothing of that is let fall to them.

               <p>But then, whether that taſte was real, or only called ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was much like, and did did reſemble a true taſte; yet certainly, 1. it was but an evaniſhing flaſh, it was but a lightn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no continuing heat flowing from a principle within to feed and give life unto it. And thus, 2. it was empty and weak, fleeting in the affections, and not reaching the heart to make an impreſſion upon it; by it the ſtreams (the actings of the heart) were ſomewhat enlightned and ſweetned, but the fountain (and heart it ſelf) was not bettered or altered

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47554:221"/>ſhall not ſind it again, if they will ask and make enquiry for it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22, 24. Fourthly, when they have it, they prize and eſteem highly of it. Fifthly, they labour to maintain and cheriſh it: Sixthly, it is their affliction to want it, and they long for it: And ſeventhly, they diligently ſeek after it in the uſe of every ordinance. But it is not ſo with carnall hearts; it is, 1. a myſtery, and 2. for the moſt part a matter of mocking to them; they do not, 3. prize it; nor, 4. long for it; and if it come, 5. it ſurprizeth them in any ordinance (as it were) at unawares; and then, 6. they undervalue it; and, 7. do not labour to retain it; and thus, 8. it quickly vaniſheth and paſſeth away, never to return again, and <hi>the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>But to return, 5. It were no difficult work here to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply particulars; as, 1. If ſuch motions come regularly and in the uſe of the ordinances, if while thou art waiting and longing for the breathings of the Spirit; if it blow upon thy garden, while thou art ſaying, <hi>awake, O north wind.</hi> If fire fall on thy ſacrifice (as it did upon <hi>Elijahs,</hi> 1 King. 18.36.37, 38.) thou mayeſt ſafely conclude, that it came from, heaven. 2. If theſe motions be followed with ſutable engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and promiſes, if, as we are moved and ſtirred up to do good, ſo we are carefull to do, and make conſcience to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that motion; and if, as we promiſe and pray well, ſo we live well and are circumſpect in our walk; we do not go to work by fits and ſtarts, but keep a conſtant courſe in our walking with God, and praying to him; here there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation, if one link of this golden chain be broken, the whole becometh uſeleſs, yea, loſeth its name and nature, it is no more gold, but tinne or braſs. He cannot pray well, who doth not live well, <hi>&amp; è contra.</hi> But, 3. the work of the Spirit is ſometimes ſo ſignal and remarkable, that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a full and clear evidence with it; as, 1. when it is ſo notable and eminent, that it elevateth the ſoul above the ſphere of nature, and thus, <hi>by his</hi> work it ſelf, the Lord diſcovereth his hand: 2. Though the work be not ſo eminent and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it may bring alongſt with it a torch in its hand, to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:47554:221"/>let us ſee the place from which it came; and thus the Spirit witneſſeth <hi>with his work;</hi> and whether his finger be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the one way or the other, whether he thus work, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we need not an additional teſtimony to confirm what he hath deponed: There will then be no place for this caſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We might here apply moſt of the characters brought for clearing the former quaeree concerning Sathans ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which here will be as diſcriminative as they are there; as, 1. if theſe motions be ſpiritual, as to the motives and end, they cannot flow from nature; for no<note n="(b)" place="margin">Nihil agit ſupra ſphaeram acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis.</note> agent can act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its own ſphere. 2. If they ſtir us up to do in a right maner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we will not reſume the ſeveral particulars; only let us preſſe the laſt a little further. Now the motions of the Spirit do manifeſtly differ from our natural motions, as to their <hi>effect</hi> upon the heart. For, 1. they being weak (as we have ſhown, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.) they can make no lively impreſſion upon the heart, nor engage the affections; and thus they are often choaked and repelled; yea, albeit when they (as in <hi>Jehu</hi>) are animated by ſelf-intereſt and baſe carnall ends, Sathan alſo obſtetricating and putting his to hand to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work, albeit thus they become violent and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet they are helpleſſe; though they preſſe the heart to yield, yet they furniſh no ſtrength for doing in a ſutable and ſpiritual maner; though they may add vigour to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man in its natural actings; and thus alſo there may be a habit, facility and gift acquired for producing the like acts hereafter, yet the heart is no whit bettered, nor thereby made to fall in love with the beauty of holineſs; the doing of one duty thus, doth not fit and prepare the heart for doing better, and more ſpiritually hereafter, but rather indiſpoſeth it, by habituating it to do in a formal carnal maner. O! but the Spirit of God, is <hi>the Spirit of power,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. who, as he exciteth us to do, ſo alſo aſſiſteth us in doing, and enableth us to do well, and in an acceptable maner; he helpeth our infirmities, and ſupplieth our weakneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.11. He maketh us beleeve, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47554:222"/>then ſpeak, he will ſtir up faith to act, and thereby fit and prepare the heart to pour out its deſires to God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.10. Its true, the Saints may meet with ſtreitnings, and ly under much deadneſs, when the ſpirit begins to move, but even then, they meet with ſecret ſtrength and aſſiſtance, whereby they are ſupported to hold our, and not give over, nor to yield to the contrary ſuggeſtions of Sathan and the fleſh; and therefore we ſhould not alwayes meaſure the Spirits help by ſenſe &amp; feeling, but when thus it cannot be ſo ſenſibly diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though it truly be afforded, yet we cannot make uſe of it, as a mark and ſign for clearing the preſent caſe, till in the iſſue this miſt and darkneſs be diſpelled. 2. Then, wait, and the viſion ſhall come, it ſhall not tarry; ere it be long, ye ſhall diſcern his hand to your comfort, and find a ſweet ſent and ſavour left upon the heart behind him; when he cometh, he will leave ſome myrrh upon the handles of the lock, which will make our fingers drop ſweetly, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.5. Laſtly, as natural motions do not <hi>poſitively</hi> amend and make the heart better, ſo neither do they <hi>negatively</hi> amend it, or make it leſs evill; as they add no good to it, ſo they take no evil out of it; though the acts of ſin may be <hi>reſtrained,</hi> yet the habits are not <hi>debilitated;</hi> though the ſtreams be ſtopt, yet the fountain ſtill abideth full; though ſome branches be cut off, yet the bulk and root ſuffereth not prejudice, but may be all the while growing and enlarging it ſelf. O! but the Spirit helpeth with might in the inner, as well as in the outward man, he helpeth us to do, not only ſome outward <hi>acts,</hi> but alſo to pull down the ſtrong <hi>holds</hi> of Sathan, and every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and high <hi>thing,</hi> that would exalt it ſelf againſt God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.

               <hi>poured out their heart before the Lord;</hi> their frequency was not accompanied with fervency, their ſacrifices lay cold on the Altar, there came no fire from heaven to kindle them; and will the Lord accept ſuch empty and deceitfull oblations? he cannot away with them, they are an abomination unto him; and what mater of lamentation is it, that ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment ſhould be thus waſted, and ſuch a noble work prove ſo fruitleſs and unprofitable, that ſo excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing an exerciſe, if rightly performed, ſhould be a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying womb. We are ready to complain of the Lord, that he will not hear nor hearken to our cry, whileas the fault is in our ſelves, we will not cry; he valueth not the voice of our tongue: but if the heart did ſpeak, he would quickly hear and anſwer; if we would ſeriouſly reflect upon the frame of our ſoul, and diligently ponder our wayes and work, we would find, nay, Gods own people and honeſt ſervants might ſee and be convinced, that too often they ſend an unfaithfull meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the throne, who doth miſcarry and mar our cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot ſpeak, and is not acquainted with the language of the court. And thus we receive not becauſe we do not ask; our asking is no asking in Gods account, becauſe we do not ask aright, and do not ſeek God in that way in which he will be found: and therefore it concerns us to take heed what kind of prayers we offer up to God, leſt our labour be loſt and the Lord provoked againſt us, while we are ready to conceive that we are doing him good ſervice.</p>
            <p>And for the direction of ſuch as would not trade with heaven with counterfit coyn, and who deſire not to be found amongſt the number of thoſe<note n="(n)" place="margin">Jer. 48.10.</note> curſed mockers, who do the work of the Lord negligently and deceitfully, we purpoſe now (in the Lords ſtrength) to enquire after the <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conditions</hi> and <hi>properties</hi> of an acceptable and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer. We would not have theſe terms to be preſſed
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47554:224"/>in their ſtrict and philoſophical ſenſe, as if we minded now to enquire what did belong to prayer as <hi>eſſentials,</hi> what only as <hi>accidentals, reciprocal</hi> or not <hi>reciprocal;</hi> but having in the firſt part of this Treatiſe, ſpoken to thoſe things that more properly ſerve to the opening up the <hi>nature</hi> of prayer, we ſhall now take a view of thoſe things that belong to the maner of performance, and which are ſo neceſſary to its prevalency and acceptance. All which, if we duly ponder, will be found (as it were) to flow from the two laſt particulars, mentioned in the <hi>deſcription,</hi>

And though the merit of Chriſt and the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might be called conditions, yet they are no intrinſecal part of our work, though our prayers muſt be, as it were, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and enlivened by them: but now we are to ſpeak of that which muſt be wrought by us, and be from us, (though ſuppoſing the aſſiſtance of the Spirit whereby we are enabled thereunto) and therefore the diſparity is manifeſt.</p>

And hence, too many, through their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:47554:225"/>negligence, irreverence and precipitancy in the worſhip of God, in ſtead of a ſweet ſavour, do offer up to him the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of fools,</hi> Eccl. 5.1.

We muſt firſt lay down our weapons, and accept his pardon, before he will accept our ſupplications and fulfill our deſires: And therefore, if thou reſolveſt ſtill to hold up the former feud, and only comeſt to God in a ſtrait, and to ſerve thy turn, I may appeal to thy own conſcience (if there be any reliques of light and ingenuity left there) whether it were not a righteous thing with God to deal with thee according to thy folly.</p>

               <p>But though theſe two be very conſiderable; 1. the ſtate of the perſon; for what father will not hearken more to the cry of his ſon and child, then to the voice of a ſtranger and enemy? 2. the quality of the work; for who would lay braſs in the ballance with gold? Yet theſe are not the main grounds of diſcrimination and difference, as to the preſent caſe, concerning the acceptance and audience of the one and not the other; but that muſt be brought from another root, which now we ſhall only name, as being already more fully

               <p>A third reaſon of the point, may be this; we cannot pray acceptably without the help and aſſiſtance of the Spirit, unleſs he enable us to ſpeak and teach us what to ſay; ah! what can we plead upon the account of any (though never ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) work as coming from us?

If we were to ſpeak to ſome great perſon, eſpecially if to a King, how would we pre-medirate and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what we ſhould ſay, and how we ſhould carry our ſelves in his preſence? and yet we will be at no pains to meet the great King; it is true, he will accept of the ſighs and ſobs of mourners, though we do but<note n="(k)" place="margin">Iſa. 38.14.</note> lament as a dove, and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter as a ſwallow and crane, he will pity and ſhew mercy: but, alas! we baſely abuſe this aſtoniſhing condeſcenſion.

If thou wouldſt ſet ſome time apart ſeriouſly to ponder and meditate, what a great and dreadfull Majeſty, and yet how loving and mercifull, thou haſt to deal with, that would beget both reverence and confidence; if thou wouldſt conſider his omni-preſence and omni ſcience, this would ſtir thee up to watchfulneſs, it would ſix thy heart and prevent wandring thoughts; if thou didſt remember his power and omnipotence, his fidelity and truth, this would ſtrengthen thy faith and expectation of ſucceſs; if thou wouldſt conſider who thou art, what is thy diſtance as a poor creature, and yet more in that thou art ſo great a ſinner, and he the juſt and holy Lord, this would beget humility and godly fear; if thou wouldſt lay to heart thy ſeveral wants, and what thou ſtands in need of for<note n="(l)" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3.</note> life and godlineſs, what are thy ſtraits and dangers, and what kindneſs the Lord hath hitherto ſhe wed, and what long-ſuffering and patience he hath ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not ſay, that all are alike unfit and unprepared, or that upon every occaſion we ſhould ſpend ſo much or ſo much time upon this preparatory work. When the heart is in ſuch a ſpiritual frame and diſpoſition as his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47554:232"/>was, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42.1, 2. when it thirſteth and panteth after the living Lord, it were a pity to ſtay ſuch a longing ſoul for one moment from the fountain. And, 2. we will not alwayes have opportunity (eſpecially when we are occaſionally called to joyn with others) thus to prepare for the work; but then we may dart up ſome ſhort ejaculation to God for his help and aſſiſtance, which we may confidently expect when the work of preparation was not ſlighted, by reaſon of our ſloth and negligence; and though thou didſt ſet apart a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time for meditation, eſpecially when thou meeteſt with ſome extraordinary occaſion, and when thou joyneſt faſting to prayer, (for even thoſe who, for ordinary, neglect this work, will then be at ſome pains to prepare their hearts for that more ſolemn exerciſe) but whatever be the occaſion and whenſoever thou goeſt about that duty, ſuch ſhort and eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory petitions might well be intermixed all alongſt the work; thus we may bring help from heaven and engage God in our quarrel, it is not good to wreſtle alone with a hard heart. I have read of <hi>Luther,</hi> that whenever he found any diſtemper and indiſpoſition creep on, he would inſtantly go to the throne and complain of it to God; and certainly prayer is one of the beſt preparations for prayer, this was <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 141.1, 2, 3, 4. he would review his heart and his wayes, and his prayers, and make one prayer the object of another, (he would pray for ſucceſs both to the prayer he had made and was to make, and thus make prayer a tranſition from paayer to prayer) They who know what a hard task it is to recall their thoughts from worldly and diſtracting cares, and to ſilence our luſts after they are once in arms, they will ſee a neceſſity of divine aſſiſtance, and to diſpatch a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to the throne of Grace for that effect. Though it be neceſſary to meditate upon, and conſider our wayes, and to take a view of ſuch motives as may imbitter our caſe unto us; yet unleſs an omnipotent arme go alongſt with, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe conſiderations, they will not prevail with our deaf and ſtubborn hearts, nor draw them off theſe lovers and turn them to God: and therefore, ſince in our private converſe with him we are allowed the liberty to intermix thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:47554:232"/>and to joyn prayer with meditation; we would not in our practice ſeparate thoſe two, which are thus ſo mutually helpfull one to the other, and both ſo ſubſervient and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in diſpoſing and preparing the heart for a more ſolemn addreſs to God: a little eating before meal prepareth a weak ſtomach, and ſetteth an edge upon the appetite, but long faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing takes away the the ſtomach, and blunts the deſire after meat; prayer is the beſt harbenger for prayer; and a little guſt of the heavenly <hi>manna</hi> will diſpoſe for a ſet meal; but the longer we diſcontinue our acquaintance with God, our love waxeth the colder, and the heart the more dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed for a communion with him; and he is thus provoked to hide his face when we draw nigh to him.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee what ſhould be done, and will ye thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to ſeek the Lord? but if ye will not, if deadneſs and indiſpoſition come on, if the Lord with draw and<note n="(m)" place="margin">Pſ. 66.20.</note>

                  <p>But, 2, Albeit, thus we muſt attend and be ſerious in the work of the Lord, yet that is not enough; we cannot <hi>ſerve God acceptably</hi> in any point of his worſhip, far leſs in prayer, unleſs we do it with <hi>reverence and godly fear,</hi> Heb, 12.28. This godly fear is ſo neceſſary, that it is frequently put for the whole worſhip of God, and a holy man is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by it; and as it is thus ſo excellent in it ſelf, and ſo neceſſary for us, ſo it prevaileth very much with God; For, <hi>He will fulfill the deſire of them that fear him; he will hear their cry, and will ſave them.</hi> Pſ. 145.19. O! but every fear is not this reverential and <hi>godly fear;</hi> there may be much fear in the ſoul, and yet this may be wanting; the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were exceedingly afraid, when they heard Gods voice out of the midſt of the fire, and cryed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ah I <hi>this great fire will conſume us.</hi> Deut. 5.24, 25. yet there was little of this holy fear in them, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared in their frequent murmuring; and therefore ſaith the Lord, there, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>O! that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me.</hi> They did then fear
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47554:242"/>God, but O! ſaith the Lord, if they would fear me aright: there is a <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh fear of God,</hi> only becauſe of his power, juſtice and terrours, and there is much of this fear in hell, where it is accompanied with much enmity and hatred of, and rebellion againſt him; and though on earth it may produce an out-ſide and half-reformation, yet no cordial and heart-renovation; though ſome may thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to commit ſin, yet it makes them not hate ſin; though it may diſturb and drive away the thief from his prey, yet it will not make him leave off to covet it; this fear may perplex a man, and put him on the rack, but it cannot convert him, and turn the heart unto the Lord. But then there is a ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and <hi>filial fear</hi> of reverence, due diſtance and reſpect; which though it exclude not Gods juſtice (for we may thus fear him, as being able to caſt into hell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.5.) yet is mainly converſant about, 1. his majeſty and greatneſs; 2. his bounty and goodneſs: his excellency begets reverence, and makes us keep a due diſtance; and his loving kindneſs makes us ſtand in aw, and fear leaſt we grieve and offend him; though the Son did not fear the rod, yet would he ſtand in awe and be loth to offend his kind Father; and the greater the Fathers kindneſs, and the love of the Son be, the Fathers diſpleaſure will be the more grievous unto the Son; <hi>when the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall return and</hi> cordially <hi>ſeek the Lord their God, they ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs.</hi> Hoſ. 3.5. Ah! were there any thing of this reverence and filial fear in the heart, it would be as a load-ſtone to draw us in to God, and it would be as honey and the honey-comb, to ſweeten our communion with him, and make us go about our duty cheerfully; and what a notable guard and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would it prove againſt wandring thoughts? and what attention and ſeriouſneſs would it beget and maintain? When we ſpeak to a King, with what diligence will we watch over our thoughts, words, and whole carriage? the reverence we ow to him will make us circumſpect. And is it not the want of that reverence we ow to the infinite majeſty of the great God, that maketh us ſo careleſs and negligent of his worſhip? But O! if we did more ſeriouſly mind our ſtiſtance,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47554:243"/>and did conſider what baſe ſinfull wretches we are, who are admitted to draw nigh to the<note n="(d)" place="margin">Mal. 1.14.</note> great King, if we did lay to heart his condeſcending love, his mercy and goodneſs, yet not fotgetting his excellency and greatneſs, with what both <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> might we approach to him?

                  <p>This godly ſincerity, that is ſo neceſſary to the acceptance of prayer, extends, not only to the act and deſire therein expreſſed, but alſo to the principle and fountain, the end, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and motives; I grant that the ſincerity of the <hi>heart abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> and as to our Chriſtian profeſſion, our covenant and engagement to the Lord, muſt be preſuppoſed, as pertaining to the previous qualifications mentioned, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.

Nay, if thus thou reſtrain prayer, and caſt thy duty behind thy back, and forſake Gods work and ſervice, [the Maſter<note n="(m)" place="margin">Gurnall <hi>pag.</hi> 624.</note> may ſend thee to ſchool with a rod at thy back, the Lord may ſend out a ſtorm to bring back his fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Jonah's,</hi> and thou mayeſt fear leſt thy <hi>omiſſion</hi> be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with deſertion, and Gods leaving thee to fall into ſome ſin of <hi>commiſſion;</hi> he that leaves a duty may fear to be left to commit a crime.] 8.

Arm. part. 3. pag. 614. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it would be here obſerved, that it is one thing to <hi>weary in prayer,</hi> and another to <hi>weary of prayer;</hi> the Saints too often (through the weakneſs and debility of grace, and the renewed aſſaults of Sathan and their luſts) may faint and weary in prayer, when yet they do not weary of their duty, and deſire not to be fred of that yoke: they love their Maſter, and like his work, even while they are ſweating at it, and fainting under it; as a Tradeſ-man may love his work and employment, albeit through weakneſs of body and ſome diſtemper, he be not able to follow it as formerly; and it will be his affliction that he is not able to go about it as he would, and thus he is not weary of his trade, but of his ſickneſs and weakneſs; thus the godly are rather weary of their deadneſs, indiſpoſition and unfitneſs to pray, then of prayer it ſelf, and not becauſe it is their duty to pray, but becauſe they cannot pray better; and thus they take pains to get that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition removed, that they may pray more inſtantly and affectionatly; and if it be thus with thee, the Lord will not account his work to be interrupted, by ſuch a diverſion, thou mayeſt be ſaid to pray with perſeverance, notwithſtanding of ſuch fainting fits and involuntary diſtempers. I deny not, that Sathan and our luſts, may labour to beget prejudices in the heart againſt the duty it ſelf, and may ſo far prevail as to divide the heart, and occaſion a confuſion, not unlike that which was in that aſſembly, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.32.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:47554:254"/>true Iſraelite, as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.21, 22.23, 25. When evil is thus preſent, there is a ſecret willingneſs to do good, and a delighting in the worſhip of God; even when the fleſh ſerves the law of ſin, yet the regenerat mind doth ſtill own God, his work and ſervice: And though for a while, and as to ſome particular ſute, through the violence of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and temptations, there may be an interruption of, and ceſſation from prayer, yet grace at length prevaileth, and the new man muſt not die in that ſwoun and fit, he muſt recover and go about his buſineſs, and do his firſt work (and the firſt word the child ſpeaketh, after that <hi>deliquium</hi> is over, muſt be <hi>Abba Father</hi>) becauſe the Phyſitian never leaveth him, but holds him continually by the right hand, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.23. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.5.

                  <p>You will ſay, the object of that doubting and wavering that is forbidden in prayer, is the promiſe of God; thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended for not <hi>ſtaggering at the promiſe through unbelief,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>Anſ. Faith</hi> and <hi>doubting</hi> muſt be relative to one and the ſame object, otherwiſe there would not be an oppoſition; and therefore, ſince faith muſt lay hold on a promiſe, ſo doubting doth counter-act our faith and aſſault the promiſe. But, the queſtion is, what is that promiſe which is the object of that faith that is required in prayer, and ſo of that doubting that is condemned in, and may fruſtrate our prayers? And I ſhould think, that there were little ground to move ſuch a queſtion; 1. becauſe all the promiſes being an intimation and declaration of God's purpoſe, to give to us ſuch and ſuch mercies, we cannot doubt of our <hi>receiving,</hi> but we muſt alſo doubt of the promiſe that intimateth Gods purpoſe to <hi>give:</hi> For, as in other caſes, ſo alſo in this, <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> are <hi>cor-relatives,</hi> and the one muſt ſuppoſe and infer the other. But, 2. albeit faith in prayer doth lay hold on the promiſes, as relative <hi>to us,</hi> yet it doth not reſt there, but the moſt proper and formal object of that faith, which is required as a ſpecial condition of prayer, is the promiſe made <hi>to praeyer</hi> concerning its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and audience; and therefore, that doubting which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, muſt be the doubting of the prevalency of prayer, and not concerning the truth of the promiſe in a general and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract maner: it is the doubting of the event and of Gods work, rather then of his word; and albeit the one (as hath
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47554:260"/>been obſerved) may, by juſt and neceſſary conſequence, be collected from the other, yet the ſupplicant may make an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and labour to divert the diſpute from the truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſenſe or meaning and conditions of the promiſe, where, though he may allow to himſelf a greater liberty, yet in the iſſue and upon the mater, theſe doubtings, concerning the meaning of the promiſe, do reſolve in doubting concerning its truth: But, that the doubting which faith doth exclude importeth both the one and the other, but eſpecially the latter, is evident from thoſe places already cited, in which this faith is required; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask, believing, ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>What (you will ſay) can be the object of faith in ſuch a caſe?

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47554:262"/>ſpeculative, but practical and influential; ſuch muſt taſte and ſee that God is gracious. 2.

It doth enlarge and capacitat the ſoul for receiving more, and a greater meaſure of the beſt things; it will leave a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly impreſſion behind, which is a fit diſpoſition for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings. 4. Prayer will encreaſe our humility and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear (then certainly it muſt baniſh all opinion of merit, and ſo muſt overturn that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls one of the principal and chief ends of prayer) but let us further obſerve the reaſon he annexeth, and we may conſider-with what conſcience or candor Papiſts do oppoſe the truth. For (ſaith he) we muſt know we are beggars, and therefore muſt carry in all humility when we approach before God. 5. It will beget in us a contempt of earthly things, for he that is often in heaven, cannot but look down upon all things under the Sun, and be ſenſible of their vanity. 6. (As we heard from <hi>Suarez</hi>) it begetteth and bringeth with it admirable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delight, while in that ordinance we taſte and ſee the goodneſs of the Lord.

And thus we may ſee what good may be gotten, and how great and excellent things may be obtained by prayer, though the particular be not granted.

Otherwiſe,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:47554:263"/>2. It muſt be granted, that we might in our ſeveral ſtraits and difficulties, as well go about any other duty as prayer, at leaſt whenſoever (and that falls out very often) the particular we ask is not given: and thus, in ſuch a caſe, prayer will be no more ſutable and pertinent to the afflicted, then any other Chriſtian exerciſe.

If we look upon the preſcription of a Phyſitian, we may there ſee ſeveral ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which ſingly and by themſelves, would rather hurt then profit the patient; but if we take in the correctives, and more narrowly obſerve the compoſition: we will be forced to commend the art and knowledge of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and to confeſs that all together do joyntly concur, and contribute for the patients health. So, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that whether God give or withhold the particular, he doth what is for our good, and what is moſt fit and convenient for us: if all things muſt work together for our God, then certainly the ſeveral anſwers and returns to our prayers; and this we may (as well as theſe Romans did) know, and ſhould believe. 6. Thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which hold out Gods purpoſe to withhold no good thing from his upright ſupplicants, as, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.10. &amp;c. as they do ſhow, that when the particular askt, is withheld, it is not good for us, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> ſo they may ſerve to convince and perſwade us, that when the particular is withheld, the Lord doth what is beſt for us upon ſuch an occaſion. 7.

And hence we may draw a new argument for confirming the main concluſion concerning the aſſurance of audience, and we may argue thus; all our prayers ought to be ſo qualified that in the cloſe we may be able to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> but unleſſe we be aſſured of their ſucceſs, and that they will be heard, we cannot truly ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. We muſt either abandon and omit that uſual poſt-ſcript and concluſion of prayer, or we muſt ſpeak we know not what, if we be not aſſured of the ſucceſs of our prayers, we cannot ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> unleſs, as we <hi>deſire,</hi> ſo we <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>expect</hi> to be heard.</note> 
                     <hi>aſſurance to be heard</hi> to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> Mat. 6.13. But, 2. the Lord hath not left us thus to collect a promiſe, either from the commands, or from that pattern and example, or from a word, which though it doth emphatically expreſs it to the more learned, yet not ſo clearly, as that others might ſee or be perſuaded hereof; but we have expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; 1. indefinite; 2. univerſal; and, 3. particular, to aſſure us that our prayers for others ſhall be heard; 1. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,</hi> ask and ye ſhall receive, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Job.</hi> 16.24. 2. <hi>univerſall</hi> whatſoever ye ſhall ask ſhall be given, and nothing witheld, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe hath no limitation, it is as full and comprehenſive as if all particulars had been named and expreſſed; and therefore ſhould we deviſe reſtrictions and exceptions of our own, and without warrant ſay, that theſe large promiſes muſt be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſonal mercies, which concern the ſupplicant? 3. <hi>particular.</hi> Thus the Lord promiſeth to raiſe up the ſick, and to forgive his ſins, in anſwer to the prayers of the Elders of the Church, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. And while the <hi>prayer of faith</hi> is ſaid to ſave (<hi>viz.</hi> as a mean of divine appointment) the ſick, the words need not a commentary; for thereby is clearly held forth, faith in the <hi>ſubject,</hi> or in the perſons who did pray; and not in the <hi>object,</hi> or in him for whom they ſhould pray; for the faith here required is relative to the duty, as its qualification; and ſo muſt be acted while they duty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and by him who performeth it; otherwiſe ſuch a
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:47554:269"/>prayer could not be called the prayer of faith, but rather a prayer for the faithfull: and thus it is added, <hi>v.</hi> 16. that <hi>the effectual fervent prayer</hi> (not for, but) <hi>of a righteous man, availeth much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, although no mercy can be received or improven aright, but by the faithfull, yet that faith in the object is not a neceſſary qualification for the audience and ſucceſs of our prayers for others, or that whereupon our faith doth lay hold is certain. 1. Becauſe faith muſt have a more ſure foundation then our conjecture concerning the ſtate of others, whether they be in the faith or not. 2. We muſt pray for unbelievers and ask grace for ſuch as are graceleſs, and we muſt ask in faith, otherwiſe (ſaith reverend<note n="(m)" place="margin">Calv. <hi>loc, cit.</hi> viz. <hi>in</hi> Jac. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Calvin</hi>) we pray deceitfully, and not ſeriouſly or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 3. The Lord often giveth grace to the unconverted in anſwer to the prayers of his children; thus <hi>Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is thought to be the fruit of <hi>Stephens</hi> laſt prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60. and therefore, faith being the object of prayer and the thing petitioned <hi>for them,</hi> cannot be a condition of prayer, nor ſomewhat previous <hi>in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, but what kind of faith can we act in praying for others? and what is its object? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:47554:270"/>and every one of our ſupplications ſhall have a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable inſluence in procuring the bleſſing.] Albeit the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be for a long time with-held, yet the Lord keepeth all the prayers of all his honeſt ſupplicants in remembrance, and in anſwer to them the mercy in due time ſhall be given. Albeit <hi>Monica,</hi> for a long time, prayed for her ſon <hi>Auſtin</hi> his converſion, yet none of her prayers were loſt; the Lord had them all on record, and at laſt ſatisfied the deſire of that zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous woman: but, we muſt not imagine that God then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had regard to the prayer put up about the time of her ſons converſion, nay but every tear and prayer, which from time to time ſhe had poured out, had influence upon the work, and helped forward the new birth of that convert. But, 2. as to the <hi>compenſation,</hi> (when the Lord purpoſeth not to hear and give the particular we prayed for to others) that will not be made to them for whom we pray, but to us who pray: for they being reprobats and deſpiſers of the mercies of God, no ordinance can do them good; but if they be Saints, and yet the Lord in his holy and wiſe providence will not give them ſuch outward mercies (for, as to ſpirituals, theſe ſhall not be finally with-held from ſuch) as we did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for them, albeit the Lord may, and no doubt often doth, make ſome compenſation to them, and will not ſuffer them to be deprived of the fruit of our prayers, although what we did ask was not good, <hi>hic &amp; nunc;</hi> yet, that which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and in all caſes our faith may lay hold on, by way of compenſation when the particular is with-held, muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſpecting the ſupplicant himſelf, ſome one or other mercy to be beſtowed on him by way of return and anſwer to his prayers; and thus, while we pray for the ſalvation of reprobats, or for ſuch publick mercies to the Church and People of God, which he, according to the depth of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, hath determined not to give, our prayers notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are not loſt as to us; for, though Iſraelites captivity be continued, yet they who love and pray for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall proſper, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 122.6.

                  <p>If it be here askt, whether the former aſſertion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods hearing and anſwering of all our prayers ſo far, as alwayes to do what is beſt for us, in the particular which we deſired and petitioned, whether (I ſay) that hath place in this caſe? <hi>Anſ.</hi> That aſſertion it ſelf, without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, might have prevented ſuch a queſtion; for, while the mater of our prayer is not perſonal, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us but others, it ſeemeth a little impertinent to ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord, when he giveth not the particular askt, (<hi>viz.</hi> to others) doth that which is beſt for us: for what doth not concern us cannot be ſaid to be more or leſs convenient for us. But, 2. albeit what we ask for others doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, as to our perſonal loſs or advantage, (except when we ask publick mercies for the Church, or Incorporation whereof we are members) yet to a believer, (who already hath a right to all perſonal happineſs and felicity) no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation can be made for thoſe ſpiritual mercies which he doth ask for his brethren, or for publick mercies to the Church, her deliverance, peace, proſperity, encreaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> could ſubſcribe a very ſad doom againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in reference to their own crown and perſonal ſtate;<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Exod. 32.32.</note>

                  <p>And yet even in this, as in all other caſes, it is certain, that God alwayes doth what is beſt and moſt ſubſervient to thoſe high and great ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifeſtation of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the promoving the good and eternal happineſs of the Elect; and as to thoſe great things, to which all other things muſt ſtoop and be in ſubordination, ſo alſo our prayers, and what we ask, whether for our ſelves or others, muſt be askt with an eye to this noble mark: and we ſhould not deſire nor expect a return, but in ſubordination to this high end. And therefore, when the event doth diſcover his purpoſe not to give the particular we deſired for others, we muſt ſubmit
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:47554:271"/>to his holy and wiſe diſpenſation, and take encouragment, not only from the returning of our prayers into our boſom, and that perſonal reward we may confidently expect, but alſo from the former conſideration, and while we reflect upon the laſt and ultimat end of our prayers; knowing that he who is infinit in wiſdom and counſel, hath carried on the ſame by means unknown to us, yet fitteſt for the purpoſe. And if we know that Chriſts kingdom doth come, and that Gods glory is thus advanced, we have no cauſe to complain, whatever otherwiſe may be the ſucceſs of our prayers. And thus, if we be conſidered as ſelf-denied Chriſtians, looking moſt to the will and honour of our Maſter, it may in ſome ſenſe and reſpect be ſaid, that in the propoſed caſe the Lord doth that which is beſt for us, and what we moſt deſire; but otherwiſe, if we ſpeak of that diſpenſation abſolutely and in it ſelf, or in relation to its proper rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the revealed will and word of God, which is the only rule of our deſires, and which muſt determine the particulars which we may make choyce of, yea, in reference to that great end, which yet the Lord may promove and carry on by what means ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to the holy counſel of his bleſſed will; thus (I ſay) ſuch a ſad diſpenſation towards our neighbours and brethren, may be very bitter and afflictive to us; as it was to <hi>Moſes, Paul. Samuel, Jeremiah,</hi> and to the reſt of the Saints from time to time.</p>
                  <p>So much for confirmation and explication of this ſweet point, concerning the certainty of the ſucceſs of prayer; now we come to objections.

And that there is no ground for any to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:47554:274"/>queſtion ſuch a diſjunction alternative, may appear from what hath been here ſaid. But yet, we do not require ſuch an explicit, particular and determinat knowledge of both parts of the disjunction, as we have now for explication de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; but if in our addreſſes to God there be theſe two, which ſeem to be ſo eſſential and neceſſary to the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. a believing that God is; and, 2. that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. If we confidently expect a reward, though we cannot peremptorily determine what or when it ſhall be given, nor whether it ſhall be in reference to the preſent exigence, I dare not affirm that ſuch a prayer will be ſhut out, or ſuch a ſupplicant ſent away empty. Albeit it be mater of ſad regrate, that we do not more clearly and particularly know what we may expect from God, he having ſo fully revealed his mind thereanent, vet, thoſe weak and leſs-knowing Chriſtians need not fear, if, 1. they have that dogmatical faith and know that there is a God, and that he is ſuch, as he hath revealed himſelf in his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to his infinite nature and the trinity of perſons, and thoſe divine attributes and properties which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any creature, that Chriſt is the way and the life, that none can come to the Father but by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2.

Anſ.</hi> We will not now digreſs to examine thy title, albeit ſuch as have no right, uſe not to queſtion their right; So that thy very anxiety and fear may open ſome door of hope, and be ſome ground of confidence unto thee: and if thou didſt not believe, couldſt thou ſtill thus depend on God and call upon him? and (as hath been obſerved) thy not knowing thy intereſt in the promiſes, will not nullifie thy intereſt. But now, thou who ſayeſt thou daiſt not diſtruſt God, but thy ſelf and thine own ſtate, let me ask, 1. if thy faith be as ſtrong to the fulfilling of the promiſes, as to thy intereſt in them, and whether thou wouldſt ſtill doubt, though thou were aſſured that thy ſtate were ſafe? and whether thou believeſt that all the prayers of thoſe who are Saints indeed are heard, and meet with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that God doth alwayes accompliſh the many and large promiſes he hath made to prayer? Thou canſt not thus (which is too ordinary) doubt, but thou muſt call Gods fidelity in queſtion; however, thou mayeſt think or profeſs that thou doſt only doubt of thine own condition. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thou art at a point, as to thy ſtate and condition, I would ask whether thou art as confident to receive the very particular in kind which thou didſt petition, as thou art confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the goodneſs and conveniency of it for thee? If thou doſt more doubt as to the firſt, then as to the ſecond, thy doubting muſt flow from thy diſtruſting Gods goodneſs, care and fidelity; and thou canſt not ſay, that while thou comeſt before the Lord to preſent thy ſupplications to him, thou didſt believe that he would do that which was beſt for thee in ſuch a particular. 3. I would enquire, whether not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thy doubting either concerning thy ſtate or the ſucceſs of thy prayers, yet ſtill thou hingeſt and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt upon God, ſaying, with him, <hi>Job.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he ſhould ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> and call upon him as long as I live; and if it be thus with thee, thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently lay hold on that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3.

Eſpecially if, 3. we conſider, 1. the Fathers love; that myſterious love, in giving his only begotten Son to death, that we might live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. and ſhall we think, that he who ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us, will not freely with him alſo give us what we ſhall ask in his name? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>I ſay not</hi> (ſaith the Son) <hi>that I will pray the Father for you; for the Father himſelf loveth you,</hi> Joh. 16.26, 27.

But as the Father doth thus love us, and freely give, and by covenant diſpone to us all that we can deſire, or ſtand in need of; So, 2. the Son hath laid out a price for us, and by his blood hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed

And will the Lord reject thoſe prayers that are breathed into us by his Spirit? but as the Spirit doth thus help us to pray, ſo to pray in faith; as he helpeth our infirmities, by enlarging the heart, and filling it with ſpiritual affections, ſo alſo by working in us a child-like confidence, and making us cry (not only with the mouth, which were no great matter, but with the heart, having made an impreſſion and ſenſe of it there) <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.16.

                  <p>The Lord pity and pardon our unbelief, that having to do with ſuch a compaſſionat and condeſcending Lord, who hath ſtoopt ſo low, and come ſo nigh to us, who hath held forth himſelf to us under the neareſt, moſt amiable and engaging relations, and who hath taken upon him ſo many bonds to do us good; we, notwithſtanding will yet doubt of his good will, and of his faithfulneſs in performing his promiſes: Oh! 1. what a diſhonour do we offer to our kind Maſter thus to queſtion his love, care and fidelity? 2. what a ſhame to our holy profeſſion? 3. what a baſe return do we make for the many mercies we ſtill receive? and, 4. what loſs and damage do we bring to our ſelves? we expect little, and receive little; we will not truſt God, and he will not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our deſires, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Are ye now convinced of your folly and guiltineſs, in thus diſtruſting the Lord? and is it the deſire of your ſoul to have this evil cured? O! then, 1. ponder frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly theſe and ſuch like conſiderations; if this were the matter of your daily meditation, if theſe things did ſink down into your hearts, and did abide upon your ſpirits, they might prove a notable preſervative againſt your unbelief, doubtings and jealouſies. 2. Let us exerciſe our ſelves in the Scriptures; eſpecially laying hold on ſuch promiſes, as are moſt pertinent and ſutable to our condition; faith muſt have a word of promiſe whereon it muſt reſt, and the more expreſs and particular that it be, our faith will proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably cleave to it the more firmly; O! but what atheiſme muſt there lodge in that heart, that dare doubt where it hath this warrand, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord?</hi> 3.

                  <p>Now come we to ſome poſitive evidences and marks of the prayer of faith: And, 1. when the affections are much enlarged, when we meet with a gale from heaven filling the ſails, we may, and uſually do, expect that voyage will prove ſucceſsfull; when God openeth the heart, and filleth the mouth with more then ordinary boldneſs, fervency and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we readily will apprehend, that he purpoſeth to fill our hands and will not ſend us away empty, according to that word. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide,</hi> (but<note n="(e)" place="margin">Only he who is ſaid to open the ears, <hi>Pſa. 40.6.

I grant our luſts may add wings to our deſires, and be as oyl to the wheels, and make us very diligent in our purſuit: there may be a natural and carnal fervency and importunity, which will rather add to our fears, then make us in faith reſt upon Gods word, love and care; but the difference may eaſily appear, (though we will not now proſecute it) becauſe that holy zeal and importunity is, 1. ſpiritual, as to the motives and end; 2. humble, and joyned with much ſelf-emptineſs and denial; 3. tender of Gods gloty and honour; and, 4. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to his will, whileas the natural importunity is, 1. carnal; 2. proud and ſelfiſh; 3. careleſs of Gods glory and intereſt, if it might be ſatisfied; and, 4, impatient, under a fruſtration and diſappointment. O! let us labour to curb our luſts, and beat down this their impetuouſneſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; but, let us cheriſh and maintain that holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual importunity, which is ſo acceptable and prevalent with God and profitable to us: and if we would pray more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, let us pray more fervently and importunatly; when we are cold and formal in prayer, we cannot be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of ſucceſs, as knowing a lazy and careleſs way of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a kind of invitation to deny, <hi>qui timide rogat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet negare.</hi> Yea, the heathens, though they thought much babling acceptable to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. yet, in their ſacrifices,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:47554:286"/>they had a ſhadow that might have ſerved for confuting that folly; for,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Neque enim ſine igue ullum ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium fieri li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebat— Si autem mortus carbone ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficetur, ſignum neglectae reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis fore, &amp; pernicioſum nemo dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, <hi>Alex.</hi> ab <hi>Alexandro,</hi> genial. dier, lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi>

                     <hi>they would not preſume to ſacrifice without fire, and if the fire had gone out, they looked upon that as a ſign that Gods worſhip was neglected, and as a ſad</hi> omen <hi>and preſage to him for whom the ſacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If frequency in praying be added to fervency, as it may be a further ground, So another evidence and mark of confidence; without faith we would ſoon weary, <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> Pſa. 116.10. But will believing <hi>David</hi> faint and leave off, having once ſpoken? Nay, ſaith he, but I will continue inſtant in this exerciſe, and my faith being ſtrengthned by renewed mercies, given in return to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prayers, <hi>I will call upon him as long as I live,</hi> v. 2. As in handy-trades, men would ſoon weary in following them, if no gain were reaped or expected; So the Saints would too quickly faint in trading with heaven, if they did not ſee their reward: and therefore, when we continue inſtant in prayer, when we conſtantly follow that courſe, and not ſuperficially and perfunctoriouſly, but ſeriouſly and with the whole heart, our faith muſt be acting, and there muſt be ſome confidence that our labour ſhall not be loſt. But there be two caſes in which, after a ſignal maner, this reſtleſs importunity, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, frequency and continuing inſtant in prayer, doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence our faith and expectation. 1. When we meet with long and continued delayes, if notwithſtanding we continue and ſtill renew our ſupplications; thus <hi>David,</hi> under his long-continued perſecution by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> continued all the while buſie at the throne, he would not run away from God becauſe he ſeemed to hide his face, but rather maketh that ſad diſpenſation an occaſion to draw nigh to God, and turneth it in matter of complaint (not of, but) to God: as Pſa. 13.1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord?</hi> But, if we ask, what kept <hi>David</hi> all this time from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>truſted in thy mercy:</hi> his faith kept his head above the waters and ſent him often to the throne. Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. but when all other remedies prove ineffectual, faith will cure that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:47554:287"/>2. When we not only meet with delayes, but alſo many diſcouragments and contrary blaſts in our face, to make us ſtreek ſail and give over; if we notwithſtanding ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our duty, and continue to wreſtle with God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances while be thus ſeemeth to ſight againſt us by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we muſt have our loins girt and our ſpiritual armour on, and above all, we muſt make uſe of the ſhield of faith in this great conflict; thus, while Chriſt ſeemed not only to ſlight the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not take notice of her or her requeſt, but alſo to reproach her as a dog; yet, ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to enforce, renew and purſue her ſuit, ſhe being (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts teſtimony of her) a woman of great faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15, 28. Thus alſo blind <hi>Bartimeous,</hi> when checked and charged to hold his peace, cryeth the more a great deal, and will not be put off till he get an anſwer from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he <hi>believed;</hi> hence our bleſſed Lord aſcribeth the whole work to his faith, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.52. If falth be ſtrong, it will ſet it ſelf againſt all diſcouragments, and, like an impetuous river, will over-flow and carry down all ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts and bulwarks that ſtand in its way; and therefore, <hi>if we faint in the day of adverſity, our ſtrength muſt be ſmall,</hi> Prov. 24.10. But, let none imagine, that while we ſay that the believing ſould will not be beaten from the throne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever impediments and diſcouragments it may meet with in the way, as if we excluded the uſe of other means; nay, faith will ſtir thee up to every mean the Lord in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offereth unto thee, as knowing, that to truſt God and to neglect the means, is to tempt God to work a miracle, and to provoke him to do no more for us, who would not improve what he offered for our help. O! but faith in the uſe of the means will, 1. regulat our choice and keep us back from all ſinfull and unlawfull means, though our ſtrait were never ſo great, and they never ſo probable and promiſing. 2. Faith will regulate the uſe of them and will make us keep them in a due ſubordination, not relying or truſting in them, but only in God, who can, as he pleaſeth, bleſs or blaſt them, and who can work for us though they were removed; and therefore, though all creature-help did fail, yet a believer could hing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47554:287"/>and depend upon a word of promiſe, till the Lord did beat him off by declaring his purpoſe as to the particular, and then ſubmiſſion will come in the place of faith. 3. As faith dare not tye God to the means, So neither as to the time, way and manner of working; it dare not limit the Lord nor preſcribe to him, but will ſecurely reſt upon Gods wiſdom, love and care, and leave all to Gods diſpoſal.</p>

Quietneſs, ſerenity, calmneſs and compoſure of ſpirit after prayer, is a good evidence of faith acted in prayer; what can liberat the heart of anxiety, fear, ſollicitude and carking cares? what can rebuke theſe ſtorms and make a calm in the ſoul if the Lord himſelf do not ſpeak peace to it, and if he do not faſten the hand of faith upon the rock of ſtrength and defence, and cauſe the ſoul reſt ſafely there, notwithſtanding all the boiſterous winds that may blow from without? <hi>Deep calleth unto deep: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: But what? had he no ſtay nor ſhelter under this ſtorm? his faith diſcovered a rock, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that he did flee; his faith did cloſe with a promiſe, which being pleaded in prayer, he eſpied a command for mercy and deliverance flowing from thence, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42.7.9.8.

Oh! truſt in God, and be no more troubled and perplexed: And to ſhew how groundleſs and unreaſonable his diſquietneſs was, he repeats this pathetick queſtion thrice, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42.5.11. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 43.5. What made <hi>Hannah,</hi> who came to the throne with a ſorrowfull ſpirit, go away rejoicing, and her countenance be no more ſad? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15.18. She came doubting and went away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; and now, knowing that God had heard her prayer, ſhe looked no more ſad. And what was it that ſupported <hi>Paul</hi> and calmed his ſpirit while he was buffeted by the meſſenger of Sathan? the tryal and temptation ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, albeit he had prayed againſt it once and again; but was

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the queſtion were concerning total unbelief, what ſin can be more grievous? But, the compariſon being between the ſeeming faith of hypocrits and the partial (may I not alſo ſay unvoluntary) unbelief of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nts, we ſhall ſpeak to that in theſe few particulars. 1. Albeit both the one and the other, in the general, profeſs their aſſent unto, and belief of, both the promiſes and threatnings; yet, in the application, there is a wofull miſcarriage on both hands, the one without ground applying the promiſes, and the other fearing the threatnings when there is no cauſe of fear. 2. Thus the one is the ſin and dolefull neck-break of the wicked, the other is the infirmity and ſad tryal of the Saints; the one is the ſin of preſumption and hypocritical kindneſs of enemies, the other the ſin of jealouſie, unkindneſs and ingratitude of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the one baniſheth fear and trouble for the time, but maketh way and prepareth for eternal wo and miſery; the other is uncomfortable for the preſent, but is like an Ecclipſe or Sea-ſickneſs that will quickly paſs. And thus, 3. the one is fooliſhly mercifull to himſelf, entertaining a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:47554:292"/>fancy of Gods mercy as ſeparated from his holineſs an juſtice; yea and denying the truth of the threatnings tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand againſt him, he laith claim to the promiſes to which he hath no right, and maketh lies his refuge, and ſo periſheth in his deluſion, going to hell laughing and rejoycing, hoping the beſt till he find the worſt, and ſee his caſe to be remeedileſs; the other is unadviſedly cruel to himſelf, tormenting and vexing his own ſoul with a needleſs jealouſie; the one goeth laughing to hell, the other weeping to heaven; the one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth a fools paradiſe on earth, the other a ſort of hell in this life, living in darkneſs till the dawning of the glorious and long-laſting day of eternity. And thus, both miſtaking their ſtate and condition, the one apprehending it to be better, the other to be worſe then it is, both paſs a wrong ſentence, the one for, the other againſt himſelf, both miſ-applying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the one to his eternal ruine, the other to his preſent trouble and diſquiet: and thus it is eaſie to judge whoſe caſe is moſt dangerous, and whoſe fault and error moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; only let me add a word to the doubting (or ſhall I ſay unbelieving) believer, from<note n="(a)" place="margin">Non ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ſi non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derem; ſed ſi vere crederem, illud cor quo Deus videtur mundarem, manibus tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derem pectus; genas lachrymis rigarem, corpore inhorreſcerem, ore pallerem, jacerem ad Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni mei pedes, coſque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the antecedent and concomitant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of an acceptable prayer, now come we to ſhow what muſt be done after we go from the throne. Ah! too many go to work heedleſsly and without all kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and perform it perfunctoriouſly and in a dead formal maner; and no wonder though ſuch have done when they have ſaid, that when they leave off to ſpeak, they minde the work no more; but thou who tookſt heed to thy ſteps while thou dreweſt nigh, and who waſt ſerious when thou didſt approach, pouring out thy ſoul unto thy God, wilt expect ſome fruit of thy labour and wilt take heed to thy wayes, leſt by thy folly, thou ſhouldſt intercept and obſtruct the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of thy prayers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, after thou haſt poured out thy complaint to God, thou muſt wait, liſten and diligently obſerve when he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and how far he anſwereth thy prayers, we muſt <hi>hear what God the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> Pſa. 85.8. If we preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſupplication to a King, how would he think himſelf mockt if we did not ſtay for an anſwer? If beggars knock and cry, but will not wait till an alms come, who will ſend it
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:47554:293"/>after them? Ah! 1. are we not Gods ſubjects and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſhould we not look up to our King and Maſter, and patiently wait till he have mercy upon us? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 123.2. 2. Did the Lord ever diſappoint them who thus did wait and depend upon him? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107.43. 3. But if ye will not wait for an anſwer, if no anſwer come, know who ſhould bear the blame; if the beggar be gone while the alms is coming, his pride, impatience and ſloth muſt be the cauſe of his not receiving; faith is not more neceſſary in asking, then that we may receive; and if ye do not wait, unbelief muſt ſay,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 King. 6, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>What? ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> And (with them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15.) <hi>What profit have we if we pray to him?</hi> It was in vain to pray and now to look for an anſwer. 4. Nay, though the Lord anſwer in wrath, and reward thy contempt and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour done to his name with ſome remarkable judgment, thou hadſt no cauſe to complain; who could endure ſuch an indignity? <hi>what is truth?</hi> ſaid <hi>Pilat</hi> to Chriſt, and when he had ſaid, he goth away and will not wait for an anſwer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18 38. Ah! will ye deal no better with the great God, then a mocking pagan dealt with Chriſt in the day of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? may ye not fear leſt he be avenged on you for this diſhonour, injury and affront offered to his Majeſty? 5. As you thus diſhonour God and provoke him not only to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deſired mercy, but alſo to take the rod in his hand; So, if the Lord ſhould anſwer, follow and purſue you with his mercies while ye are running away from him, you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your ſelves of a double advantage. 1. Of the joy and comfort that redounds to an honeſt ſupplicant, when he obſerveth God to have hearkned to his deſire; nay, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that many times ariſeth from this conſideration doth exceed the ſatisfaction reaped by the naked enjoyment of the mercy it ſelf, that being an evidence of our adoption, of Gods love towards us, of our moyen with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. We thus deprive our ſelves of a notable mean, 1. for ſtrengthning our faith in the promiſes; 2. for clearing the Lords fidelity in keeping his word to his ſervants; and, 3. for judging of the ſincerity of our hearts and wayes, and knowing when we
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:47554:293"/>have prayed acceptably; and, 4. for encouraging us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue inſtant in prayer, and to ſay, (with him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 116.2.) <hi>therefore will I call upon God as long as I live.</hi> And as thus you are injurious to your ſelves, So alſo to the Lord and to your brethren. 1. To the Lord, if he ſhould anſwer, ye who do not hearken, would not hear; ye who would not look up to him, would not ſee nor diſcern his hand, but would<note n="(b)" place="margin">Habak. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>ſacrifice to your own net,</hi> and aſcribe that mercy to your own wiſdom, activity, moyen with, or power over, ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture helper and ſecond cauſe: and thus, though God ſhould <hi>deliver us in the day of our trouble, yet we would not glorifie him;</hi> nor would we (with him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 116.1, 2.) ſay, <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice,</hi> &amp;c. 2. If we were carefull to ponder Gods wayes towards us, and laid up experiences, we might be helpfull to others, eſpecially to weak Saints and to children of light walking in darkneſs; our experiences might prove a mean to ſupport and ſtrengthen their faith; <hi>if God regard the prayer of the deſtitute, this ſhall be written for the generation to come,</hi> Pſa. 102.17, 18. See this point more fully demonſtrated and improven, by Mr. <hi>Goodw. Ret. of Pray. ch.</hi> 10. Ah! where is the man who hath not reaſon to ſmite his breaſt and ſay, wo's me that I am ſo guilty of ſo vile, ungrate, fooliſh and miſchievous an offence? O! let us juſtifie God if he hath not heard us, while we did not liſten nor hear what he would ſay; and O! if we were more carefull to amend this fault that is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary, that we would no more ſo carry, as if we thought with Atheiſts that our praying were loſt labour: and if we will truſt God and depend upon him, we ſhall have no cauſe to be aſhamed of our expectation, he will not fail nor diſappoint us; if we will go to our watch-tower (as the Prophet did after he had prayed, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we would (with him, <hi>ch.</hi> 2.3.) find, that an anſwer would at length come; that at the end it ſhould ſpeak and not lie; though it tarried (as to our ſenſe and apprehenſion) yet if we waited for it, it ſhould not tarry nor be ſuſpended for one moment, after the fit, convenient and due time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:47554:294"/>But as this waiting upon God doth import a looking up to him, ſo, 2. a patient and ſubmiſſive, a ſilent and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expectation, and not fainting all the while the Lord delayeth to anſwer our prayers; <hi>he that believeth will not make haſt,</hi> but will patiently wait upon the Lord his God, till he have mercy upon him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 28.16., <hi>Pſ.</hi> 123.2. he will not fret becauſe of croſs-diſpenſations, but will reſt on the Lord, and commit his way unto him; knowing, that at length he will bring forth his righteouſneſs as light, and his judgment as the noon-day, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37.7, 5, 6. <hi>We have need of patience, that we may receive the promiſe.</hi> Leaſt, if we fret, the promiſed mercy be withheld, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. Its not enough, that we once believe and aſſent to the promiſe, but we muſt wait the fit time for its accompliſhment: And thus, as we have need of <hi>faith,</hi> ſo alſo of <hi>patience,</hi> that we may inherit, and be put in poſſeſſion of the promiſed mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. Some Pagans have ſhown much magnanimity and compoſure of ſpirit under their trials and ſad diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who yet were ſtrangers to this confident and filial dependance upon God, and to this Chriſtian patience, which is founded upon better grounds and ſpiritual motives, and which is the daughter of faith, and one of the priviledges and ornaments of the heirs of glory; being of a heavenly deſcent, and coming from him, who is the fountain and author of all our graces: we would ſoon faint, if we were not <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-ſuffering, with joyfulneſs,</hi> Coloſ. 1.11. There may be ſome appearance of joy in hypocrits and mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, in the day of their trouble and trial, but there can be no real and ſolid joy, but in beleevers, who know, that <hi>yet a little whi e, and he who ſhall come will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10.37. And that the Lord waiteth till the fit and appointed time come, that he may be gracious to us, and bleſs us indeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. As the Spirit helpeth us to pray, ſo to wait till the fit time for us to receive come; hence, the Lord is called <hi>the God of patience,</hi> not only becauſe he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth it toward us, but<note n="(c)" place="margin">Eſpecially ſince there alſo he is called <hi>the God of conſolation,</hi> which muſt be interpreted of his working of it in us, and making us rejoyce,</note> becauſe he worketh it in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.5. O! then let us labour to exerciſe this heavenly
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:47554:294"/>grace, and our labour ſhall not be in vain; the more thou doſt venture in thy trade with heaven, and the greater ſtock of prayers thou ſendeſt forth, thou mayeſt expect the larger return; nay, and the longer thou waiteſt, thou maiſt expect the more gain; as knowing thy trade to be carrying on all the while, and thy ſtock to be in his hand, who during the delay will improve it to thy beſt advantage, who will not ſuffer it to miſcarry, nor thee to be on the loſing hand who haſt intruſted it to him; yea, and, 2. ſuch mercies as are long expected and waited for, are moſt ſweet and welcom<note n="(d)" place="margin">

A love-letter and token from a dear friend, we thought to have been dead, will bring much delight and content; and thoſe veſſels, when the voyages prove long and dangerous, ſo that the owners have made their account they ſhall never hear of them again, as they uſe to return with the greater advantage, ſo their return is more refreſhing and comfortable; ſo when our faith is ready to fail, and we look upon our prayers as<note n="(e)" place="margin">Eccl. 11, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>bread caſt upon the waters,</hi> and as ſo much loſt pains; when an anſwer cometh, and a love-token from our God (whom we through unbelief had almoſt thought to have forgotten us) O, how ſweet and acceptable will it prove! and the oftner we read and peruſe thoſe miſſives from our heavenly Father (eſpecially coming by the hand of a meſſenger we judged to be loſt, and as dead) we will obſerve ſome precious, and (as it were) new paſſages, which will mightily refreſh and comfort us, and will become a ſeal and notable evidence of his love to us, and ſtrong a ſupport of our faith and confidence in him. But, 3. if we weary and faint, we may, through our impatience and diſcontent, provoke the Lord to recall (as it were) his former grant, and not to anſwer theſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which otherwiſe might have laid claim to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and would not have wanted a gracious return and anſwer.</p>
               <p>But as we muſt thus wait, ſo, 2. we muſt <hi>watch;</hi> as we muſt look <hi>up</hi> to God, ſo we muſt look <hi>in</hi> to our own hearts,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:47554:295"/>and <hi>about</hi> us, to our wayes and courſe; as we muſt watch <hi>unto</hi> prayer, and <hi>in</hi> prayer, ſo alſo <hi>after</hi> prayer. Sathan alwaies lieth in wait, and we know not; he may have a train laid, when and where we are leaſt apprehenſive of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but when we ſee any temptation which is his ſcout, we may know that the enemy of our ſouls is not far off: and that we become not a prey to his temptations, we muſt <hi>watch and pray,</hi> Mar. 26.41. There muſt be a reciprocal ſequel, and conſequence of the one from the other; as we muſt watch and pray, So we muſt pray and watch; nay, upon a ſpecial account we muſt watch after prayer, that the influence of that ordinance may abide upon our heart, and that we loſe not that life, vigour and heat which uſeth to accompany the ſpiritual performance of this heavenly exerciſe; a cold catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after heat is moſt dangerous, and yet it is moſt uſual, if it be not prevented by a watchfull care and circumſpection: And therefore, as <hi>in prayer</hi> we muſt<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> lift up holy <hi>hands,</hi> ſo <hi>after prayer</hi> we would take heed to our <hi>feet,</hi> and that when we come from the throne, we do not run to the<note n="(g)" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> mire to wallow in it. <hi>If we would receive whatſoever we ask, we muſt keep the commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in the ſight of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.22. The Lord will hide his face from them, who behave themſelves ill in their doings, and will not hear them though they cry, <hi>Micah,</hi> 3.4. If we regard iniquity in our heart (whether before or after prayer) the Lord will not hear nor anſwer us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 66.18. If the Saints, after they have prayed, and are waiting for an anſwer, return to folly, God will not ſpeak peace, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 85, 8. Sin will make God hide his face and draw back his hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. If after we went from the Kings preſence, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed his commands, plotted and conſpired againſt him, and that under his eye, and while he were looking on; what folly and madneſs were it to expect that he would regard and anſwer theſe ſupplications we had preſented to him; and is not this our caſe? Ah! many deſperate ſinners deal no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with God, then <hi>Abſolom</hi> with <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.30. while the Lord delayes to anſwer their requeſts, <hi>they ſet his field on fire,</hi> and ſet their face againſt the heavens, as if they
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:47554:295"/>thought to break him with their ill deeds, whom they could not perſwade by entreaties; or elſe, ſince they cannot help the matter, either in revenge againſt God, or to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to themſelves, they will<note n="(h)" place="margin">Hoſ. 2.7.</note>

               <p n="3">3. As we muſt watch and pray, and pray and watch, ſo we muſt pray and <hi>pray;</hi> its not enough once to preſent our requeſts, but we muſt renue our ſute and fortifie our plea; we muſt ask again and again, <hi>we muſt not keep ſilence, nor hold our peace, nor give him any reſt</hi> (according to the expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.2.) till he ſhew mercy upon us, and grant our requeſts; thus the primitive Church prayed for <hi>Peters</hi> enlargement and deliverance, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5. And thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and commanded to follow this courſe; the gates of heaven are never ſhut, and thou maiſt get acceſs to the King when, and as often as thou wilt, he will not chide with thee, becauſe of thy importunity and frequent addreſſes, but he complaineth when we faint and hold our peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22. and commands us <hi>to continue inſtant in prayer,</hi> Rom. 12.12. Eph. 6.18. Coloſ. 4.2. 1 Theſ. 5.17.

And giveth this as one reaſon why he will not anſwer hypocrits, crying to him in the day of their trouble; becauſe <hi>they having no delight in the Almighty, will not alwaies call upon him,</hi> Job, 27.9, 10. Prayer is a weariſome burden to many, which they muſt quickly ſhake off, and then for a pretence, are ready to ſay (with him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33.) its in vain to wait upon God any longer; we are ready to complain that God will not hear, while he regrateth we will not cry; if we continued inſtant in prayer, an anſwer would certainly come, and would not tarry.

I fear, I have never yet prayed aright: and, O! that I might know whether all theſe qualifications, were eſſential and neceſſary; and if all be not alike neceſſary, what be thoſe requiſits which are more, and what leſs neceſſary. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit often ſuch as have leaſt cauſe to fear, are moſt jealous of themſelves and their way; yet, 1. it's certain,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that too many prayers are lik <hi>water ſpilt on the ground,</hi> and like the <hi>beating of the air,</hi> they being as no prayers in Gods account, becauſe not ſuch, and ſo qualified as he hath commanded, and doth require; and there is none of thoſe qualifications we have named, which are not held forth and preſcribed in the Word of God, and which doth not concur to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the work, and contribute to its acceptance and ſucceſs: and therefore it were better (with the Pſalmiſt, when he was going to praiſe God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.1.) to ſtir up our ſoul and all that is within us, to joyn and contribute their help and aſſiſtance for the cheerfull and acceptable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our duty, not ſeparating what the Lord hath conjoyned; then to trouble our ſelves with ſuch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and by enquiring what may be forbo n, ſpared and left undone, of that which the Lord hath commanded and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yet, 2. that no tender conſcience may be diſquieted, and that none may go about this duty with terrour and fear,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which ſhould be performed with ſo much Son-like boldneſs and confidence; we grant that there are Scripture-grounds, and Scripture-inſtances, which, with the daily experiences of all Saints, do make it unqueſtionable that God hath heard, and will hear the prayers of his ſervants, though they do not punctually obſerve and reflect upon all theſe ſeveral ſteps; and therefore, ſuppoſing, 1. that thou doſt not wilfully, ſtubbornly and purpoſely omit, or ſlight any part of thy duty; 2. that thou haſt reſpect to all Gods commandments, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:47554:299"/>to order thy whole converſation aright; 3. that thou prayeſt, 1. in ſincerity, with <hi>Hannah,</hi> pouring out thy ſoul before the Lord; 2. in faith, relying upon Chriſts merit and interceſſion, and in his name coming to God as the hearer of prayers, and the rewarder of all them who diligently ſeek him; and, 3. with an eye to his glory, arming at that as thy great and chief ſcope and end; 4. that thou dependeſt upon him, patiently waiting till he ſhew mercy upon thee, not daring to limitat and preſcribe to him, nor murmuring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delayeth to give, or withholdeth the particular thou deſireſt; and, 5. that if he fill thy hands with his mercies, thy heart and mouth will be filled with his praiſes; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I ſay, that thou doſt pray thus, that the truth and reality of all theſe (in whatſoever meaſure or degree) are to be found in thy prayers, thou needeſt not fear; thy prayers are acceptable, and the Lord will in his owe time and way hear and anſwer thee, and as a Father pitieth the ſickneſs and weakneſs of his tender Child, So the Lord in mercy pitieth thee, and covereth all thine infirmities, and notwithſtanding thou maiſt in faith plead the promiſes of audience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently wait for and anſwer to thy prayers. But, 3. If thou make conſcience of theſe few particulars,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which thou wilt not deny to be ſo neceſſary, the reſt will not altogether be deficient and wanting, though they be not ſo diſcernable and obvious to every eye, nor ſo diſtinctly, expreſly, and in ſuch a meaſure and maner as theſe we have now named, and which appear to be more neceſſary; and therefore, though theſe other qualifications be not ſeen, yet they are, and have place in thy prayer; they are virtually and in the root, they are truly and in ſome meaſure, though not ſenſibly and in ſuch a degree or perfection; ſo that albeit thou haſt not ſet ſo much time a part for preparing thy heart, and albeit thou canſt not ſay thou art a ſon, and in the ſtate of grace, that thou prayeſt in the holy Ghoſt, that thy ends are ſo pure and ſpiritual, that thou haſt ſuch a meaſure of humility, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>importunity, confidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet thou, who doſt thus call upon God in ſincerity, art in ſome meaſure fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to meet thy God, thou art in the ſtate of grace, and

The difference, as to this which is between the works of nature and grace, doth very convincingly ſhow, that this different way of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration <hi>through the Son and by the Spirit,</hi> doth not relate to that natural order of working, but to this gracious eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy; otherwiſe the works of nature, as well as the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits and actions of the Saints might be aſcribed to the Spirit as his work, and might be ſaid to be diſpenſed through Chriſt, and for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>That which here ſeemeth only to have difficulty, is, what is the fruit and ſpecial benefit of this economy, as to the holy Ghoſt, and what is it that thereby is ſuperadded to that natural order of working which agreeth to him as the third perſon of the bleſſed Trinity? <hi>Anſ.</hi> We may not

While its ask't what the Spirit worketh by virtue of this economy? <hi>Anſ.</hi> When thou comeſt home to thy fathers houſe, and ſeeſt his face, either thy curioſity ſhall be ſilenced, or ſatisfied: but now, if thou only askeſt what? we may rather ask what not? Are not all the gracious actings of the Spirit, and the whole work of ſanctification firſt and laſt, the ſweet fruit of this economy, covenant and tranſaction, and without which our caſe had been as bad and deſperate as the devils? and now the Spirit by virtue of that covenant, not only works, but <hi>creates</hi> grace <hi>in ſubjecto inhabili,</hi> where there was no inclination, fitneſs, or preparation, till he began to work; and not only actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atch grace where he hath wrought it, and concurreth with it, but alſo ſupplieth the defect of the cauſe and principle it ſelf, which ſtill remaineth <hi>incompleat</hi> till he perfect it in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47554:315"/>which is another kind of providence, nor what is afforded to natural agents: And holineſs, ſanctification and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being the <hi>third great work</hi> of God, which by virtue of that voluntary tranſaction remained to be wrought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſons of men, that did lie upon the <hi>third perſon</hi> of the bleſſed Trinity; and thus, by this eternal covenant, <hi>holineſs</hi> was fitly appropriated to the <hi>holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we may ſee, that there is not a full enumeration in the three-membred diſtinction of <hi>miſſion</hi> (ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inculcated in the Schools) 1. <hi>per imperium,</hi> or by <hi>command,</hi> which ſuppoſeth the ſubjection of him who is ſent; 2. <hi>per conſilium,</hi> or by <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>advice,</hi> which ſuppoſeth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance in him who is ſent; 3. <hi>per originem,</hi> or by <hi>natural deſcent,</hi> as trees ſend forth their branches, and this (ſay they) kind of miſſion only hath place among the perſons of the Trinity; but we may doubt if any where in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the word <hi>miſſion</hi> or <hi>ſending,</hi> is put to ſignifie the natural proceſſion of any of the perſons of the Trinity? but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from what hath been ſaid, it may appear, that this three-footed diſtinction doth halt and wanteth one of its legs, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But though the Lord thus may for holy ends (known to himſelf, but alwaies for the good of his honeſt ſervants) withdraw his Spirit in ſome meaſure from theſe, who have not by their negligence or folly procured it, they being moſt regular and exemplar in their walk, yet, 1. ſince moſt uſually the Lord withdraws for ſin; and, 2. ſince we alwaies
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:47554:321"/>deſerve, and may (if the Lord would deal in juſtice with us) by our failings provoke the holy Spirit to depart and forſake us; and, 3. Since the Lords high and holy ends and deſigns are ſecret, and cannot well at the firſt view be diſcerned by us, therefore it is alwaies our duty, and ſhould be our work, when we meet with ſtraitning, deadneſs, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> (which are the ſymptoms of the Spirits withdrawing) to ſearch after our waies, and to examin our hearts, that if our conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us not, we may be comforted, or having found out the cauſe, and the particular ſin for which the Spirit hath withdrawn, we may repent and forſake it; but we would not reſt on a ſuperficial veiw of our waies, nor becauſe we cannot at the firſt diſcern, therefore conclude there is no cauſe in us; but let us, according to <hi>Elihu</hi> his counſel to <hi>Job, ſay unto God, that which I ſee not, teach thou me,</hi> Job, 34.32. Let us impartially deal with our own heart, and ask conſcience, and ſet it a work; let us again ponder our waies, and let our enquiry be more particular, and of a larger extent, and readily we will eſpie one of the following cauſes to have procured and brought on this malady, and will perhaps be forced with him<note n="(o)" place="margin">Tu me non deſeris, niſi prior ego te deſeram, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> tom. <hi>9.</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus we come to the ſecond thing propounded; what are theſe ſins for which the Spirit is provok't to withdraw and forſake the Saints, and not help them in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any other ſpiritual performance; at leaſt not in ſuch a meaſure or maner as formerly?

For in the three former Caſes, when the Lord for our trial, and for high and holy ends known to his majeſty, doth depart, albeit then it be our duty to ſearch and enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our folly we have procured that ſtroke, that ſeeing our fault, we may amend our waies, and how ever we may walk more cloſely and circumſpectly, and follow after him while he withdraweth from us; yet then no ſuch cauſe can be diſcerned and found out, becauſe (as is ſuppoſed) the Lord in
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:47554:321"/>that diſpenſation doth not purſue a quarel againſt us. 2. We would diſtinguiſh between the comforting preſence of the Spirit, and his quickning and ſtrengthning preſence; there may be much life, vivacity, activity, fervency and heart-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, or any other ordinance, when through the want of aſſurance the Saints may mourn and pour out many a ſad complaint before the Lord; now albeit both thoſe caſes belong to the general head of deſertion, and have ſome place here in reference to prayer, ſince our enlargement in that duty doth not a little depend upon, and might be much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by, the aſſurance of our adoption, reconciliation, and God's favour; yet, ſince there needeth nothing be here added to what belongs to the general caſe, we ſhall remit that part of the queſtion, that concerneth the comforting preſence of the Spirit to its own place, and now only ſpeak of the cauſes why the Spirit withdraws his help and aſſiſtance; eſpecially ſince the cauſes and cure both of the one and the other, will be found the ſame and alike, if not altogether, yet for the moſt part; as the Spirit uſeth to withdraw his comforting, when he withdraweth his quickning preſence, So what means would be uſed for recovering the quickning, may alſo prove inſtrumental for regaining the Spirits comforting preſence, albeit the one may prevent the other, and the Spirit may for a while quicken and aſſiſt before be comfort.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47554:335"/>uncomfortable to the adulterous wife, but want of love? love is an uniting affection, and pretend what we will, the want of love to God is the cauſe why we weary at his work, and in his company; for the heart not being fixed by the bond of love, nor arreſted by delight, it gads abroad, and would be rid of the duty, as of a weariſom burden; hence wandring thoughts break in, and the duty is marred; but in heaven, when we ſhall ſee God face to face, and love him perfectly, we ſhall not weary of his fellowſhip unto all eternity.</p>
                  <p>We will not digreſs to ſpeak to theſe motives which may ſerve to quicken our love, but certainly if <hi>we loved the Lord</hi> as we ſhould, we could not, it would be an inſupportable burden to ſtay out of his company; and we would ſooner part with our life then abandon his fellowſhip; and <hi>Daniel</hi> would let others know, that he ſerved ſuch a maſter as he would not be aſhamed to own, and go unto, notwithſtanding all their cruelty and threatnings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.

                  <p>WE would not think it worth the while to confute thoſe dreaming Sectaries who plead, that we ſhould not draw nigh to God till he ſend out his Spirit, and till we ſenſibly find ſome impreſſion from heaven drawing and inviting us to come to the throne; but ſince weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may meet with the like temptations, we ſhall labour briefly to take out of their way that ſtumbling block, and to ſhew them that their very deadneſs and indiſpoſition, is ground enough for them to draw nigh to the Phyſitian that they may be healed, ſo far is it from being an obſtruction and impediment, or a plea for our negligence and omiſſion of duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe one ſin cannot be a plea for another; now our deadneſs and indiſpoſition is our ſin; and therefore muſt not be alledged as a reaſon for our neglect of prayer, which is our duty, as well as our priviledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This were the ready way to Atheiſm, and to caſt behind us all the ordinances of life, and to abandon them for ever; for if thou be unfit to day, and upon that account lieſt by, thou will readily be more unfit to morrow, and ſo from time to time; the longer thou ſtayeſt away from God, the diſtance will be the greater, till at length it become an eaſie and tolerable burden to continue in that ſtate; <hi>omiſſion</hi> of duty will prove a bad <hi>preparation</hi> for it, but thus thou wilt
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:47554:344"/>contract an habit of idleneſs, which thou wilt not eaſily caſt off.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou do not reſolve to mock God, and ſlight his work, but wilt ſtir up the little ſtrength thou haſt, waiting upon the breathings and aſſiſtance of his Spirit, though thou wert never ſo weak and indiſpoſed, thy oblation coming from a willing mind, and according to what thou haſt, it will be accepted in Chriſt, who pittieth thy weakneſs, and will not reject thy ſupplication upon the account of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed infirmities; and thou needeſt not doubt whether ſuch a prayer be more acceptable then no prayer, nor ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were better not to pray, then to pray no better? For it is granted on all hands, that the very moral vertues of Pagans, were more acceptable then the want of them, and that thoſe workers of moral righteouſneſs were leſs guilty, then thoſe other Pagans who omitted them. Hence, we may well argue from<note n="(a)" place="margin">A pari</note> 
                     <hi>the like,</hi> that thy performance of duty muſt be more acceptable, then the omiſſion of it, eſpecially ſince there muſt be ſome life in thy work (if a Saint though weak) while there was none in theirs, and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, through whom thy imperfections will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and done away.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit may draw inſenſibly, he may be preſent <hi>effectively,</hi> where he is not <hi>feelingly,</hi> he may be ſtirring up the heart to the duty, though thou doſt not diſcern his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his help and aſſiſtance may be at hand when thou art ready to apprehend he is fartheſt off; and have not the Saints many a time brought a heavy, dejected and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit to the throne, and yet have gone away rejoycing and triumphing over their fears and unbelief? As the book of Pſalms can afford many inſtances. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright,</hi> Prov. 10.29. The Lord uſeth to <hi>meet them that work righteouſneſs, and remember him in their waies,</hi> Iſa. 64.5. When we are following our duty, and improving the ordinances, we lie in Chriſts way, and he will not ſhut his eyes, but will at length pity and heal ſuch weak and impotent ones. I may then ſay unto thee, concerning the uſe of prayer and other ordinances, as <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:47554:344"/>did to <hi>Solomon</hi> in reference to the building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe therefore and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Ah! where ſhall the ſick go, but to the Phyſitian? What ſhould a troubled ſpirit do, if it may not draw nigh to God for healing, comfort and life? The Lord commands us to call upon him in the day of trouble, and hath promiſed to hear and deliver us, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.15. and who is he that dare forbid us, and threaten wrath, while he thus promiſeth to pity and ſhow mercy? and what trouble is there that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to ſoul-trouble, and what weakneſs and infirmity is like to a wounded ſpirit labouring under the fetters, bondage &amp; captivity under which it hath caſt it ſelf by its folly, ſin and negligence? and ſhall it be to no purpoſe for ſuch a one to lay out his ſtraits, and weakneſs to God?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord complaineth when we will not call on him, and <hi>ſtir up our ſelves</hi> to lay hold on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. and will he chide and challenge us when we ſtir up our hearts to cloſe with him, and look up to the throne of mercy?<note n="(k)" place="margin">Metaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra qua <hi>Paulus</hi> utitur ſumpta eſt ab igne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguo, vel qui paulatim ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingueretur, niſi flabellum ſubiude ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movendo, &amp; lignum novum ingerendo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res reſumeret ac flammam. proinde memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerimus in uſum appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda eſſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Dei, neru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biginem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I would not be ſo ſevere as alwayes to limit the Saints in their private devotion, albeit a Miniſter, or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, as it were, the mouth of others, muſt look to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work, and follow it for the good of thoſe who joyn in the duty; but if in private we meet with any notable and eminent irradiation and impulſe towards any ſpiritual object, I know no reaſon why we ſhould choak ſuch a motion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we be ſtraitned by time, ſo that if we give way to it, we muſt neglect the main duty which we intended to go about, and which our exigence doth eſpecially call for; and in ſuch a caſe we may ſee Sathans hand in it, and we ſhould beware of his wiles: But if we can eſpy none of his deſignes, we may a little follow that quickning meditation, and again return to our work happily, with more life and activity.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:47554:350"/>the influence of the ſpirit is arbitrary, both as to the ſeaſons when, and the means whereby, it is conveyed: hence, not only are ſome more enlarged in publick and others in private, but alſo one and the ſame believer may at one time be more fervent and importunat the one way, and at another time the other way; and each of theſe Ordinances have their proper and ſeveral advantages: For, firſt, in publick the gifts of the ſpeaker, and his affectionat moving and pithy words and maner of expreſſion; as alſo, the reverence and zeal of others joyning in the duty, may be very helpfull and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in ſtirring up the affections; and then in private, there is, 1. more liberty in dealing with our own hearts, and rouſing them up by ſome awakning meditation; and, 2. greater freedom in laying out our condition and expreſſing our deſires before the Lord; 3. the whole frame of the duty more condeſcending and ſuteable to our diſpoſition and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; 4. fewer diſtractions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, it is commonly made, by practical Divines, a mark of hypocriſie to be more enlarged in publick then in private. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That mark is eſpecially to be underſtood of the ſpeaker, and that, 1. when it is alwayes ſo, and when all his enlargement is in publick; and thus, 2. when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and end is ſelfiſh and carnal, as reſpect from, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of, men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But otherwiſe, both ſpeaker and hearer may meet with more then ordinary enlargement, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lord, upon the publick Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>A third queſtion may be this, Whether it be a mercy to have our prayers anſwered, and to receive the particulars we ask, when we are cold and formal in prayer, and careleſs and negligent in our walk and converſation? <hi>Anſ.</hi> We may judge by the event; for ſuch a diſpenſation may either, 1. flow from wrath, not pure, (for we do not now ſpeak of the ſucceſs and proſperity of the wicked) but paternal, penal, by way of caſtigation, yea, and in ſome reſpect judicial; for thus, for a while, they are lulled aſleep, and are ready to reſt in that ſtate and to be ſatisfied with ſuch empty performances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are accompanied with ſucceſs: and as Apoſtat <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while in proſperity, ſaid of their enjoyments, <hi>Theſe are

In both theſe Scriptures, as frequently elſewhere, threatnings are mixed with promiſes, and both may well be ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the covenant; the promiſes as its <hi>object,</hi> yea, rather as its <hi>integral parts,</hi> and the threatnings as the <hi>hedge</hi> to keep us within the bounds of the covenant, and as a cord (though ſharp) to draw us back when we ſtep aſide, and do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the conditions to which the promiſes are annexed; and thus both threatnings and rods (which are the execution of threatnings) to the Saints may be called evangelical, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſame fountain from which the promiſes do
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:47554:354"/>flow, and having a like gracious event and effect; afflictions to them, loſs, as it were, their nature and name; and though in themſelves they ſtil continue to be bitter and evil, yet to them they prove good, they are fatherly chaſtiſements, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal corroſives, and ſtill the object of the threatning, though as to the ſanctified uſe of them, and the good reaped by them, they may fall under a promiſe indirectly, <hi>&amp; in obliquo.</hi> But thus not the rod it ſelf, but the fruit of it, is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the promiſe, and this may be deſired and prayed for.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, that the Saints are <hi>afflicted in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſa. 119.75. and therefore their croſſes muſt be an accompliſhment of ſome promiſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Fidelity and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs appeareth as well in accompliſhing threatnings as promiſes; and thus the Pſalmiſt in the words cited explaineth their ſcope, while he ſaith, <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right,</hi> viz. according to thy righteous threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; and thus he juſtifieth the Lord in all the evil afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trials he had met with.</p>

<pb n="655" facs="tcp:47554:354"/>the rod was now paſt, but the fruit remained; 2. becauſe that good reaped by it being ſpiritual, did counter-ballance, yea, and far exceed the evil of the croſs; it did not only make a compenſation, but was as gold inſtead of braſs and droſs: But yet ſtill the rod in it ſelf was evil, and not to be deſired without a revelation concerning the neceſſity and fruit of it, which none can pretend to, but muſt wait till the event make that manifeſt: And as we ſhould praiſe God for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of the rod, So upon ſuppoſition we are to meet with it, we may pray for the ſame,</p>

               <p>But you will ask, what be theſe ſeaſons of prayer which we muſt obſerve and improve? <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a twofold ſeaſon of prayer, one <hi>conſtant,</hi> another <hi>occaſional:</hi> 1. then as to the conſtant ſeaſon of prayer, which every Chriſtian ſhould daily make uſe of, albeit we will not limit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Saints, yet we hope, that without hazard of a challenge from any ſober Divine, we may affirm, that the leaſt which the word of God will admit for a ſet courſe of prayer, is twice a day: as our daily wants, neceſſities, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, temptations, will ſo often, at leaſt ſend us to the throne for a ſupply, protection, deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So our mercies for their continuance and the ſanctified uſe of them; and if we have the heart of Children, we muſt ſo often at leaſt viſit and ſpeak with our Father; and if we be ſenſible of our
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:47554:365"/>enjoyments, and of his mercy and tender bowels, we will ſo often, at leaſt, offer to him the ſacrifice of praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we cannot be ſaid to do<note n="(b)" place="margin">As in the preceding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion hath been ſhown, <hi>Queſt.

                  </note> alwaies, what we do not often and frequently; and can he be ſaid to pray often or frequently, who doth not at leaſt keep a conſtant courſe of praying twice a day?</p>
               <p>But if it be askt what time of the day is fitteſt? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though we will not be peremptory in fixing upon any part of time, yet it would appear, that evening and morning were the fitteſt ſeaſons; is it not equal, that we begin and end the day in Gods worſhip and ſervice? and how dare we ſleep untill we commend our ſelves, and all that is ours to the care and cuſtody of our Father? and how dare we put our hands to any work in the morning till we praiſe him for our preſervation in the night paſt, and beg his bleſſing on the works of that day? and thus both our need, and the honour of our Maſter call for this; for what we highly prize and love dearly, will get the firſt and laſt of our thoughts, it will, as it were, ſleep and awake with us; and ſhall not the Lord have that room in our heart? is there any better object to fill it? and can the firſt and laſt of our time be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed? The Jewiſh daily ſacrifice was appointed to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the morning and evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.39. and theſe are fit ſeaſons for the Chriſtian ſacrifice, and accordingly the Saints from time to time have obſerved thoſe ſeaſons, though with ſome variety: But I ſhould think, that as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, So the firſt of the morning, and the laſt at night were due to the Lord; and if our calling, or ſome occaſional diverſion, do hinder the family from meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one ſhould then go to their cloſet, and pour out their ſoul before the Lord, till the family may moſt conveniently meet together to joyn in that exerciſe.</p>
               <p>But ye may yet ask, what warrant we have from the Scriptures to preſs this? <hi>Anſ.</hi> We did not ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſ.</note> that this was all which the Scripture doth require, but that this was. The leaſt which from thence could be allowed and eſtabliſhed. The Lord in his Word requireth, that we ſhould pray alway and without ceaſing, but doth not determine how oft, that
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:47554:366"/>albeit we ſhould ſet ſome bounds and limits to our loſſe, vain &amp; idle hearts, which otherwiſe would be ready upon any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling occaſion to ſlight and omit that duty, yet that we ſhould not reſt (as to private converſe with God) upon any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor thus ſtint and limite our ſelves; though we ſhould have our conſtant courſe of prayer morning and evening at leaſt, yet as to the occaſional ſeaſons of prayer, we ſhould be liberal and free, ſtill labouring to enlarge our ſelves more and more in this ſweet and heavenly exerciſe, reſolving (with the Pſalmiſt in the point of praiſing God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 71.14.) ſtill <hi>to pray more and more;</hi> and here the Lord would leave ſome liberty and latitude, according to the variety of our callings and employments in the world, and according to the occaſions and opportunities which in his providence he would offer; for, as ſome in reſpect of their calling and condition have more, ſome leſs time to ſpare, So one and the ſame Saint may now meet with moe occaſions and motives, then at another time, and as thus there is a great variety as to the nature of the thing, and occurring circumſtances, and no rule in the Word that doth preciſely limit and determine how oft, So neither is there any equality, as to this, among the examples recorded in the Word; neither is it uſual there to condeſcend upon any number, for as occaſions are thus ſo variable, So accordingly hath the carriage and practice of the Saints been, but as to their ſet and conſtant courſe, we will find ſome few inſtances, and yet with ſome variety.

<pb n="690" facs="tcp:47554:370"/>when either that we may ſeem devout, or that we may play the oratour, we may ingeminate the ſame words, in a ſtrain of eloquence and elegancy: 3. proud and boaſting repetitions, when we think to be heard for our much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that our vain words doth oblige the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an anſwer.</p>
               <p>But, 3. in caſe of dulneſs and indiſpoſition of heart, yea, and of bodily fainting and weakneſs, it were better to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in prayer, then to continue long in that exerciſe, and to divert a while, and by reading, meditation, or conference to ſharpen the irons, rather then to uſe them while they are ſo blunt; nay, thou mayeſt well intermix the works of thy lawfull calling, and follow thy buſineſs in the world, or moderatly uſe ſome recreation for repairing ſome natural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and activity, which may be ſubſervient in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe: We do not ſerve a hard Maſter, who will call for alike work from the weak and ſtrong, and who will allow us no time for our own work, or for fitting and preparing us for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, but were it not better alwaies to be ſhort in prayer, whatever be our fitneſs and diſpoſition, ſince theſe prayers which arerecorded in the Scriptures, are of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable length, the longeſt being that of <hi>Solomon</hi> at the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. and of our bleſſed Lord a little before his Paſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. the complaint of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 102. <hi>Ezra</hi> his confeſſion, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. the Levits thankſgiving and acknowledging of the Lords juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing that people for their ſins, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have alſo the practice of theſe Saints in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom<note n="(u)" place="margin">Loc. jam. cit.</note>

O! how do they help to maintain a heavenly and praying-diſpoſition in the heart? Theſe are the ſwift meſſengers, which upon all occaſions we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to the throne; by theſe, we may beep conſtant corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with heaven, and have our converſation there; no calling, trade, nor condition of life needs hinder this ſpiritual traffique and negotiation; the moſt laborious tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may follow his buſineſs conſtantly, and work hard in his ſhop, and thus pour out a prayer to God; ſuch a ſhort

                  <hi>parentheſis,</hi> will make no ſenſible and conſiderable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in any buſineſs or employment. And oh! what a difference is there between thoſe Chriſtians, who exerciſe themſelves in ſuch ſpiritual diverſions, and ſhort converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, and others who ſuffer their heart to ſtay ſo long here beneath, and ſo to faſten and take ſuch deep root in the earth. The Lord in his providence offereth to us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions for ſome ſpiritual thoughts and heavenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; where canſt thou caſt thine eyes, and not behold a miracle, which thou doſt ſleight, becauſe it is ordinary, and from day to day renewed, or continued? who hath covered the face of the earth with ſuch variety of herbs, flowers, <hi>&amp;c</hi> who maketh the fire to burn, the wind to blow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beſidetheſe outward occaſions, how many moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth the Spirit ſuggeſt for lifting up the heart to God? and were it not our wiſdom, not to choak theſe motions, nor let ſuch opportunities ſlip, but to dart up ſome ſhort deſire and ejaculation, till thy buſineſs permit thee to go to the throne in a more ſolemn and continued way? But let not ſuch ejaculations be pretended as a cloak for laying aſide a conſtant courſe of continued prayer; that were to make things act contrary to their nature, and to make the means which are ſubordinat, and ſhould be ſubſervient unto the end, to exclude the end; for this is one, and a main fruit of ſuch ejaculations, to fit and prepare the heart to continue inſtant in prayer, when of purpoſe we perform that ſolemn duty.</p>
               <p>But leaſt any ſhould abuſe theſe Scripture-inſtances, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe a cloak for their negligence, and want of love to the work; ſaying, what, ſhould we be more holy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer in prayer then thoſe eminent Saints whoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are recorded in the Word? Let ſuch conſider, 1. that as of ſermons, So of prayers for the moſt part we have but ſome brief notes; all was not written that was at ſuch an occaſion ſpoken by the Saints, though all was ſpoken that is written of them; and yet as to the preſent caſe there is ſo much written, as may rather make us tremble, then thus boaſt and preſume, as if it were no great matter to come that
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:47554:371"/>length; for, though the words be not ſet down, yet the time is ſometimes ſpecified, and ſuch a proportion of it, as few will make their meaſure, thus our bleſſed Lord <hi>continued all night in prayer,</hi> Luk. 6.12. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpent <hi>certain daies in faſting and prayer, Neh.</hi> 1.4. and a fourth part of a day is ſpent in prayer and confeſſion, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.3. The Jews faſted (and to what purpoſe did they faſt, if prayer was not joyned therewith?) neither eating nor drinking three daies, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.16, 17. And <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, that he had cried himſelf hoarſe, and that his throat was dried, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69.3. that all night he made his bed to ſwim, and watered his couch with tears, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 6.6. And will any dare yet to boaſt, that they have come the length required, or recorded in Scripture? But, 2. ſuch would remember, that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are ſet down in the Scriptures, were poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſpecial occaſion, and were framed only, or mainly in reference to the preſent particular; but we in our daily, and conſtant courſe of prayer, muſt look to all our wants and neceſſities; and muſt petition not ſome one mercy, but what we ſtand in need of<note n="(z)" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>for life and godlineſs,</hi> perſonal mercies, and publick mercies, mercies for our ſelves, and for all the Saints; and we ſhould particularly confeſs our ſins, with their ſeveral aggravations, and beg pardon for all our provocations, and grace and ſtrength for every duty; and praiſe God for all his mercies: And can all this be to purpoſe performed in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time as thoſe vain tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and mockers of the holy Scriptures would allow? But yet (as we ſaid in the entry) we will preſcribe no time; only we would not have any upon a miſtake to limit themſelves to a ſhorter time, then the nature of this exerciſe, and their own need doth require.</p>
               <p>But here we may behold our duty, and great priviledge to pray alwaies; as we are obliged, So it would be our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to improve every ſeaſon and opportunity of prayer: Chriſt purchaſed to us, not with his money, but with his blood this liberty to draw nigh to the King as oft as we will and as our need requireth; I have read of one, who offered to his King a great ſum of money but to have leave once or
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:47554:372"/>twice a day to come and ſay, <hi>God ſave your Majeſty.</hi> But you may not come once or twice, but as oft as you pleaſe to the King of kings, you will alwaies get acceſs, and will never be ſent away empty, and without the bleſſing; if you come to bleſs and praiſe his great Name, you ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of him; if you come to ask, you ſhall receive, not only<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark. 6.13.</note>

But ah! the folly and deſperate negligence of ſecure ſinners, who will not enter in at ſuch an open door, who will not knock nor cry, though their need preſs them never ſo much, and who will not ſeek though they have a promiſe to find; O! what diligence and frequency is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary here?

                  <p>Hence, in the general and at the firſt view, it may appear, how groundleſs and groſs the common miſtake here is; for, multitudes do think, when the Lord, in the courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, doth give what men did deſire and ask, that then he heareth and anſwereth their prayers; and on the contrary, that when he doth not give the particular that was askt, that then he doth not hear and anſwer the prayer: and this groſs and brutiſh miſtake hath in great part occaſioned, and is the main ground of this objection, and is the great ſtumbling-block whereon Atheiſts fall and ruine their ſouls. But, how falſe both theſe are, may eaſily appear, not only to thoſe who have the Word for their information, but even by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as might be made manifeſt from the Writings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: but now we muſt ſpeak to the firſt; and here we might reſume the ſeveral requiſits that do concur, and muſt be, where any mercy is received as a return of prayer; all thoſe being wanting and deficient, as to the wicked their ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving, except the firſt, and it alſo very oft, (for though outward things may be ſought and deſired, yet not in that maner and meaſure as they do, who make them their idol and place their felicity in them) and thus we have as many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove, that they receive nothing in mercy and in
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:47554:378"/>anſwer to their prayers, as we now did enumerat conditions and requiſits in the acceptance and audience of prayers; for, 1. they ask amiſs often, as to the matter, and alwayes, as to the maner and end; 2. their prayers have no gracious and ſpiritual qualification; 3. they have no intereſt in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe, neither are they objects of Gods love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which we ſhall only add a word or two; firſt, <hi>The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. and will the Lord accept and remunerat what he thus loatheth and abominateth? and yet ſuch have their deſires ſatisfied, which they durſt offer to God prayer-wayes; (for the vileſt of men may have ſome form of devotion) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For anſwer, as we would remember what the Lords hearing of prayer doth import, So we would know how, and what be the different waies after which the Lord anſwereth the prayers of his people; leaſt through our ignorance, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or want of obſervance, the Lord hear and anſwer our prayers, and yet we not know, nor take notice of his hand, as it was with <hi>Iob, ch.</hi> 9.16, 17. and the reaſon he giveth there of his miſtake, may alſo blind our eyes; for, we often, like fooliſh children, regard not what we have, and take little notice of what we receive, becauſe we get not what we would have, and what our carnal deſires crave; and thus, when the Lord delayeth for a while, though he draw nigh to us in the fit time and right ſeaſon; yet (as that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.) <hi>though he goeth by, we ſee him not; and when he paſſeth on, we perceive him not;</hi> our eyes are ſhut, that we cannot ſee his hand; and our ears are heavy, that we cannot hear what he ſaith in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to our prayers; eſpecially when the heavenly <hi>echo</hi> doth not anſwer voice, and when he giveth not the particular mercy which was askt, but ſome other thing (though better for us) by way of compenſation and gracious commutation. It would then be diligently obſerved, that the Lord may hear our prayers four different waies; 1. by way of <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> and giving the very particular we deſired, and in our
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:47554:381"/>time and manner; 2. by way of <hi>compenſation,</hi> when he giveth not the very particular, but maketh a commutation in that which is better for us; 3. by <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>You will ſay, when the Lord performeth, and ſatisfieth our deſire by giving what we askt, yea, and when he maketh a compenſation and exchange, giving us ſome other mercy in lieu of it, eſpecially when he giveth what is better, as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals in ſtead of temporals (as uſually he doth) in thoſe caſes it will not be denied, that the Lord heareth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but, 1. while he delayeth, and during the <hi>interim</hi> of the delay; 2. when he denieth what was askt, and will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the receiving of mercies enlargeth thy heart with thankfulneſs, ſelf-love makes us more forward to pray, then to give thanks; but thankfulneſs of all duties proceeds moſt from pure grace; if then the Spirit of grace doth ſtir thee up to praiſe God for his mercies, he hath helped thee to pray, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a mercy by thy prayer; it muſt then be a good ſign, that a mercy hath been <hi>won</hi> by prayer, when it is <hi>worn</hi> with thankfulneſs. 3.

                  <p>Now for the right<note n="(n)" place="margin">A Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> improvement of theſe directions, I deny not, that theſe and the like particulars deſerve our ſerious conſideration, and when they occur, may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for diſcovering the Lords mind in his diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; but we would diſtinguiſh and put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe neceſſary <hi>qualifications</hi> of prayer, which are required on our part, and which belong to the performance it ſelf, and ſo are indiſpenſably required at our hands, and between thoſe gracious <hi>diſpenſations</hi> which the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his meer good pleaſure may impart or with-hold. As to the 1. we would carefully obſerve thoſe directions that concern our duty, for, if we be negligent in prayer, and in thoſe other duties that relate thereto, or if we be looſe in our walk, we may fear the rod, but cannot expect a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:47554:390"/>return to our formal prayers. But, 2. as to thoſe ſigns that depend upon the good pleaſure of the Lord to beſtow or not, we would beware of curioſity in requiring, expecting, or looking to much after them; and of raſhneſs and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in laying too much weight upon them if they ſhou d occur: Therefore the ſafeſt and ſureſt courſe, muſt be not to lean too much to ſenſible demonſtrations of providence, but rather to reflect on Gods Word, both on the word of <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>precept,</hi> and according to that rule to judge of our prayers and their ſucceſs; and thus, though we can eſpy no ground of hope and encouragment from any diſpenſation of providence, yet if we find our prayers run parallel with the promiſe, and the qualifications and conditions thereto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and that we have prayed according to the will of God, both as to the matter and manner of performance, we need not doubt of their ſucceſs, whether we have gotten the particular we askt or not.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be enquired, whether thoſe mercies which the Saints receive when they are on the declining hand, and are negligent in their walk, and cold and formal in their prayers, be given in return to their prayers? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This queſtion doth not concern tender Chriſtians who are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in their walk, and who are buſie and d ligent (though not ſo enlarged, neither have ſuch melting affections, nor ſuch a meaſure of confidence as ſometimes they have had) in prayers, and other ordinances; whatever hard concluſions ſuch may draw againſt themſelves, yet their ſtate is ſafe, their prayers are accepted, and their mercies and enjoyments ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as may appear from, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. Neither, 2. do we now enquire concerning the health, wealth and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the wicked, and the ſucceſs of their prayers and vain oblations; their ſeeming mercies and bleſſings being curſed, and their prayers an abomination to the Lord, as hath been ſhown in the preceding Section. But, 3. we now only enquire concerning the Saints, and the ſucceſs of their prayers, when they are under a diſtemper, and are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their ſoul-trade and carriage, and cold and formal in their prayers, we do not ſeparate theſe two in the queſtion,
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:47554:391"/>becauſe in practice they are ſeldom divided: And though the moſt eminent, circumſpect and active Saints, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be lukewarm, and meet with little life or quickning in prayer or any other ordinance, yet that is but for a ſhort ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is but a fit, not a ſtate and abiding condition, and before an anſwer come, there may be a ſupply (I do not ſay a compenſation by way of merit and ſatisfaction for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer negligence, but that) there may interveen ſuch acceptable activity and fervency in prayer, as will prevail, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fore going ſlackneſs and deadneſs; and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the iſſue of their former, dead and liveleſs prayers, yet their after ſervency will not want a reward, and their enjoyments will thereby be ſanctified, and their mercies will be given in return thereto; and in this caſe there is no ground for anxiety and fear, neither hath the preſent queſtion place here, unleſs it were to ſatifie curioſity; and thus if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe formal prayers abſtractly and by themſelves, and without any reference to the after enlargement and activity in that exerciſe, we do not deny, that ſuch prayers may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the queſtion, though it mainly relate to a ſtate of negligence and formality, and to ſuch deadneſs in prayer as hath been uſual and cuſtomary, and to which way hath been given for a conſiderable ſpace of time, during which the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thus prayed for have been given. Unto which now we anſwer, That ſuch mercies ſhould not be eſteemed to be the fruit of prayer, nor be given in return thereto; 1. becauſe ſuch prayers are no prayers in Gods account; ſince the heart is not ſet a work, and doth not concur in ſuch lazy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: and can that which is no prayer, prevail? and will the Lord hearken to any voice in<note n="(o)" place="margin">Though in ſuch a caſe it may get the name, yet it is rather the picture of prayer, then the thing is ſelf.</note> prayer that proceedeth not form the heart?

Becauſe this luke-warm temper is much diſpleaſing to God; he threatneth to puniſh it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. and will he then reward it, and beſtow mercies for its ſake? 3. Such prayers are not regular, but are many wayes defective, and come ſhort of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed to the promiſe of audience; and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that the Lord may for a while puniſh and chaſtize his children as with rods, ſo with mercies, to make us know that there is ſo much of the old root in the beſt, that if the Lord with-draw his hand and with-hold the bleſſing, neither rods nor mercies could do us good, but the venom within us would ſuck poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the moſt pleaſant flowers, and turn the moſt healing medicines into deadly corroſives: Let us not then reſt on our enjoyments, though thou be a Son thy Father may grant thy deſire in anger; parents when moſt grieved and diſpleaſed with their children, may give way to them, and let them have their will without controll, but ere it be long the father will chide his ſon, and upbraid him for his medling and taking upon him; and then the ſon (if he be not an unnatural wretch) could wiſh that his liberty had rather been reſtrained, then his father in anger given way to his courſe; and who among the genuin Sons of <hi>Zion,</hi> would not rather chooſe to be under the rod, then to have his hearts deſire with the diſpleaſure of his heavenly Father?

                  <p>THe preſent queſtion is not concerning the Lords hiding himſelf from the prayers, either of the wicked or of the Saints, (that being the matter of the following Chapter) but concerning ſuch and ſuch a way of anſwering the <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fervent prayer of the righteous;</hi> which muſt prevail and cannot want a return) <hi>viz.</hi> 1. why the Lord for ſo long a
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:47554:393"/>time delayeth to give what he purpoſeth at length to give; 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why he denyeth and with-holdeth the particular mercy that was askt, and will rather give ſome other thing (which will be better for us) in lieu and conſideration of what was deſired, and thus will rather make a gracious compenſation, then grant the mercy in kind that was deſired? We ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the laſt, as being many a time the ſad tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Saints, who not ſeeing the Lords deſign, nor obſerving the compenſation (it haply being in ſpirituals which are not ſo eaſily diſcerned) have been ready to apprehend ſuch a diſpenſation to be in wrath, and that the Lord hath hid himſelf from their prayers.</p>
                  <p>But here it would be remembred, that our work is not to enquire after the meritorious and procuring cauſe, which by way of demerit doth provoke the Lord either to deny or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, becauſe although the Lord delay to give or deny what was askt, yet he doth not (as the queſtion ſuppoſeth) either deny or delay the acceptance and hearing of our prayers; yea, ſuch a denial and delay is not only in mercy and love, but by<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Chap. 3.</note> object of our prayers, it cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be given by way of return to them, yet ſince it proceeds from love, and may be very profitable to us, and thus may be askt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally and comparatively (as hath been<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſhown) we ſhall in the cloſe add a word concerning it; though ſtill it would be conſidered, that there is a great difference between this, and thoſe other deſigns which have nothing of anger and wrath in them, and here the object it ſelf being abſolutely conſidered is<note n="(d)" place="margin">Malum paena.</note> evil, a fruit and puniſhment of ſin, and a teſtimony of divine diſpleaſure, and therefore whatever be ſaid of the fruit and event, yet the thing it ſelf
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:47554:393"/>abſtractly conſidered, cannot well be called a return and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Now let us name ſome of thoſe gracious ends for which the Lord denieth to give the particular mercy we deſired; as, 1. the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of our faith and patience; graces are giuen us for uſe, as talents wherewith we ſhould trade and gain, and not to be laid up in a napkin to ruſt and corrupt, and therefore its needfull, that the Lord in his providence ſhould offer occaſions for their exerciſe; as in the preſent caſe, while he with-holdeth our hearts deſire, then in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſubmit to his holy counſel, and ſtill to depend upon him, as it muſt be the work of honeſt ſupplicants; So, 2. it is their <hi>tryal;</hi> thus the ſincerity of their hearts and reality of their grace is brought to the touch-ſtone, not only muſt our graces be exerciſed for their growth and encreaſe, but alſo for their tryal and diſcovery; and to give Sathan, the world, yea and our own hearts an evidence of their truth; yea, and ſometimes of their ſtrength and perfection, if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we meet with no ſenſible demonſtrations, yet we will believe God's Word of promiſe, depend upon him, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently bear a ſeeming repulſe and denial. 3.

                  <p>As to the ſecond branch of the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe ends for which the Lord delayeth to give what he purpoſeth at length to give; we might here reſume ſeveral particulars mentioned in the former head, as there alſo might be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of what we are now to ſay; theſe caſes not being much different as to the preſent enquiry, ſince both thoſe diſpenſations flow from one and the ſame fountain of love, wiſdom, care and fidelity of a compaſſionat father towards his children and ſervants. 1.

See <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. But it may be askt, what are thoſe ſins which in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner do obſtruct and hinder the ſucceſs of our prayers? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit we condemn the ſtoical dream concerning the equality of ſins, it being evident from the Word of truth and ſound reaſon, that there is a great difference between ſins and ſins, ſome being much more hainous and grievous then others, both in reſpect of the act, object, manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and many aggravating circumſtances; and thus thoſe ſins that are moſt grievous, hell-like, and conſcience-waſting, muſt eſpecially provoke the Lord, and mainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the acceptance and audience of prayer; yet, I know no ſin that doth not deſerve, and may not procure this ſad
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:47554:395"/>judgment. But we would here take notice of the Goſpel-condeſcenſion to the weakneſs and infirmity of the Saints; for, though the Law ſtill abideth in force, not only as a rule, and as to its <hi>direction,</hi> but alſo as a command, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its <hi>obligation,</hi> ſo that the leaſt breach of the law doth no leſs now, then while man continued in innocency, and was able perfectly to fulfill and obey it, deſerve the curſe, and make us liable to the wrath of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. yet as to the acceptance of the perſon and performances there is a ſweet mitigation in the new covenant, that covenant of grace made with ſinners in a Mediator, and the tenor of the Goſpel runneth thus, <hi>If thou ſhouldſt mark iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand? but there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared,</hi> Pſa. 130.3, 4. <hi>when we have reſpect to all he commandments</hi> (though we do not exactly fulfill them) <hi>we ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. When in ſincerity we apply our ſelves to obey God in all things, and fulfill his will, our kind Maſter will pardon and paſs over our infirmities; what the Apoſtle ſaith concerning our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duty, <hi>viz.</hi> giving of almes, upon the ſame ground will hold in every caſe, and may be lookt upon as a general rule whereby we may judge concerning the acceptance of all our duties and ſervice. <hi>viz. When there is a willing mind, and a performance out of that which we have</hi> (or according to our power and ability) <hi>it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.11, 12.

And not only is this the beſt courſe for finding out the ground of the Lords controverſie againſt every man in particular, but alſo for knowing and removing the cauſe why he contendeth with a Church or Nation; for albeit there may be publick, common and ſcandalous ſins, which ſhould be publickly acknowledged and repented of, yet that is not ſufficient, but every one muſt deſcend to his own heart, and ponder his own wayes, and forſake the evil of his doings: and here there will be found a great variety, and almoſt as many different cauſes as perſons; yea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may fall out, that the ſole ground of the preſent
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:47554:396"/>controverſie againſt a people, may be ſome ſecret groſs ſin committed by one or ſome few among them, as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.11.12. And albeit then <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not tell why the Lords anger was kindled againſt that people, yet <hi>Achan</hi> might eaſily have found out the cauſe, he knew that he had taken, and where he had laid the Babyloniſh garment, and wedge of gold.</p>
                  <p>But though we need not come to particulars, yet in the general it would be obſerved, that prayer-obſtruction may be procured either by ſin <hi>in praying,</hi> or <hi>in him who prayeth;</hi> as for the, 1. <hi>viz.</hi> ſins in, or about prayer it ſelf, let us reflect on the qualifications and requiſits of prayer held forth, <hi>Part</hi> 2. and from thence judge of the defects of prayer; and thus it will appear, that thoſe prayers do carry in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom an evidence and witneſs againſt themſelves, and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pleader, in which, or with which is, 1. pride and ſelf-worth; 2. hypocriſie and unſoundneſs; 3. formality and lip-devotion; 4. anger, malice and envy; 5. unbelief and diſtruſt; 6. baſe, carnal and ſelfiſh ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But, the queſtion now is, when wicked men come to ſuch a ſtate, that prayer will be no more a mean to do them good? when they may be ſaid to have loſt the ſeaſon and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of audience, and to have let ſlip the day of grace and acceptable time? and that they may, yea and that many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do, come to ſuch a ſtate, may be made appear from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Scriptures, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24.28. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18.41. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Iob</hi> 27.9. &amp;c.

                  <p>As to the firſt, though the Scriptures do not hold forth any general and infallible rules, whereby we may here judge and paſs a peremptory ſentence; yet, both Scripture and experience do point out ſeveral grounds of fear: and from thence we ſhall briefly offer ſome few ſignes and characters, whereby we may more then probably gueſs and conjecture whoſe names are written in this black roll. And, O how terrible and awaking may ſuch a point be? and with what amazement ſhould ſecure ſinners (were they not judicially plagued and deſerted) hear ſuch a diſcovery? which is not

But the queſtion is, who are they who muſt periſh in that way, and who, in all probability, (yea, unleſs by a miracle of mercy they be reclaimed) will never turn nor ſeek the Lord with the whole heart, and therefore will never meet with audience and acceptance, though they ſhould call upon him?

There is little hope of mockers of piety, haters of God and of his ſervants, and who are ready to revile and tear their faithfull monitors and reprovers; I joyn theſe, becauſe uſually they go hand in hand: for hatred of holineſs, as it floweth from enimity againſt God, So it will beget eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt his children and ſervants and a curſed impatience and rage at their warning and rebukes.</p>

<pb n="763" facs="tcp:47554:407"/>Lord teſtifieth, (and whether ſhall we believe his report or their vain lying words?) that it hateth him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.18. But, let ſuch haters of God and of our Lord Jeſus know, to their terror, that their names are written in the catalogue of thoſe who are <hi>given over to a reprobat mind,</hi> Rom. 1.30.28. and though, for a time, viſible judgments may be with-held, yet, ere it be long, <hi>Gods right hand ſhall find out all thoſe that hate him,</hi> Pſ. 27.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the former root muſt ſpring hatred of the godly and of godlineſs; as they who love him that begat, love them alſo that are begotten of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. So on the contrary, ſuch as hate the Father will not love the children; and therefore, haters of God muſt hate the godly, and upon this very account, becauſe they bear his mage in their heart, and expreſs it in their life and converſation; and thus, as the bloody murderers at the maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> not finding the famous and learned Martyr, <hi>P.

Hence the perſecution of the Saints may well, and by juſt interpretation, be called <hi>Deicide,</hi> and the Lord will one day reckon with oppreſſors of his people, for all the wrongs and injuries done to them, as if they had been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly done to his holy majeſty, according to that word, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye;</hi> and, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.45. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſaith the head in glory, complaining of the oppreſſion of his ſuffering members on earth.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but will ſome ſay, we were not worthy to live if we loved not God; but for theſe profeſſors, they are a pack of hypocrits, conceity and troubleſom people, and we cannot endure them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We deny not, 1. that difference of opinion may occaſion very ſharp and hot debates among the Saints themſelves; and, 2. that the godly are more affected with, and diſpleaſed at, the ſins and failings of brethren, and

The old<note n="(p)" place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> enimity between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent, doth ſtir up the wicked againſt the Saints; and though they would cloak their hatred with ſome fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet the Lord knoweth that ſuch are acted by <hi>Cains</hi> principle, <hi>who ſlew his brother, becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.12.

                  <p>As to the other two branches of this black mark, <hi>viz.</hi> mocking of piety and rageing at a reproof, they need not be ſeparated; for, as mockers of piety and of the Saints are the worſt of ſinners, So they are moſt obdured, and have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thimſelves againſt all arrows of reproof, and therefore will be ready to reverberat and ſend them back againſt the

<pb n="781" facs="tcp:47554:411"/>But let me tell thee, O ſecure and deſperat ſinner, who wilt be at no pains, and yet complaineſt of the terrors of the Almighty, as thou began with the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, abuſing it, and encouraging thy ſelf from thence to add ſin to ſin, and to continue in thy wicked wayes, So after thou haſt ſerved thy turn with that moſt glorious attribute, which ſhould have led thee in to repentance, thou now takeſt thy ſelf to his <hi>juſtice</hi> and threatenings, as if theſe did chaſe thee away, and hold thee off from cloſing with, and ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord; while indeed they ſhould drive thee in to him, and make thee forſake and turn from the evil of thy doings: But will the Lord ſuffer infatuated ſinners thus to mock his holy Majeſty, and to pervert and abuſe thoſe divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and to encourage themſelves from thence to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their wickedneſs and rebellion againſt him? and were it not a righteous thing with him, to ſend ſuch fools to hell to learn wiſdom there? that they might become better divines then to bring from heaven a cloak, pretence, or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſin (for as ſinners in hell know better the evil and parentage of ſin, So they are more ſenſible of their own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and ſince at length they have taken themſelves to Gods juſtice and ſeverity, were it not fit to make them find the power of his juſtice and wrath unto all eternity?</p>
                  <p>But, 2. if thou be indeed awakened, and to purpoſe pricked in heart, and askeſt, what muſt I do? is there no remedy? I would counſel thee to humble thy ſelf before the Lord, and to cry mightily for a broken and contrit ſpirit; thy caſe is moſt ſad and dangerous, and thou muſt not expect to go through without trouble and difficulty; the impoſthume is inveterat, and therefore thou muſt ſuffer the lancet to go the deeper; what ever courſe the Lord take with others, who have not ſo grieved and diſhonoured him, and though he draw them in with a word of love, and ſoftly open their heart, as he did <hi>Lydias,</hi> Act. 16.14. yet if ever thou be born again, its likely to be by ſore labour and travail; all who are about thee will hear thee cry out of the pangs of thy new birth: and the deeper the foundation be caſt, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be the ſurer and ſtronger; and the more ſick thou

                  <p>For, 3. albeit thy caſe be ſo dangerous, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deſperat; and therefore thou mayſt ſeek after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and muſt ſeek the more diligently; general threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings though moſt peremptory and irrevocable (as it would appear by the maner of expreſſion) yet leave room to the free grace and mercy of God to pity whom he will; its his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prerogative to ſcrape out whoſe name he pleaſeth out of the black roll of judgments, either ſpiritual or temporal, and that he may magnifie the riches of his free grace he will ſometimes lay hold on the worſt of ſinners, on <hi>Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> the Theef, <hi>Rahab, Mary Magdalene,</hi> &amp;c. We need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not have named theſe, or any ſuch in ſtances, for theſe are well known to ſuch as know little more of the Scriptures, and it were good for them that they either knew more, or that they knew not ſo much, ſince they make that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a wofull ſnare to themſelves; for what ſhould be an encouragment, and open a door of hope to penitent ſinners to turn from their evil wayes to the living God, they make a ground and encouragment to continue in their ſins, to delay their repentance, and turn their back on God: To thee then, and for thy uſe, O mourning penitent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolat one, are thoſe examples, and (as it were) miracles of mercy recorded in the Word, that thou ſhouldſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, but lay hold on the ſure word of promiſe and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>whoſoever will, let him take,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. &amp;c. Is not that a ſweet and full Word? is there not room enough there for to receive thee? is not that a plaiſter fitted for thy ſore? is not that Word large and comprehenſive, both as to perſons their condition and exigence, and as to the circumſtance of time? O do not then ſay, ah! that it had come a little ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of grace was paſt, its too late for me now to lay hold on mercy when the doors are ſhut and lockt by an irrevocable threatening; for the day of grace is never ſo far ſpent to any ſincere penitent, but he hath day-light enough to let him ſee home; and the door of mercy alwayes ſtands
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:47554:412"/>open to ſuch, and they ſhall have no reaſon to complain that they came too late and could find no entry: The promiſes of the Goſpel know no other term, but what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent; <hi>when I ſay unto the wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely dye, if he turn from his ſin, he ſhall ſurely live, and not dye,</hi> Ezek. 33.14, 15.

                  <p>But you will ſay, I ſaw in theſe characters my name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſuch legible letters, that he who runs might have read; my caſe and condition was ſo ſet out to the life, that no place was left for ſhifts and evaſions, I know my ſelf to be included in one or moe of thoſe curſed ranks, and is it poſſible for me to eſcape that dreadfull ſentence pronounced againſt me by the mouth of him who is truth it ſelf? <hi>Anſ.</hi> But may not the Lord give the occaſion with <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>I who was before a blaſphemer, perſecuter and miſcrable wretch, have now obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3.4.

<pb n="787" facs="tcp:47554:414"/>deſperat ſinner out of the ſnare: thou wilt become a new creature indeed, and all who know thee, will have reaſon to praiſe God for thee, and from that time forth thou will walk humbly, circumſpectly and exemplarly: thou wilt often look on the skar of thy old wound, and thou wilt ſay (with <hi>Paul</hi> in a like caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8.9.) <hi>I was as one born out of due time, I am the leaſt of all Saints, that am not meet to be called a Saint, becauſe I,</hi> &amp;c. And thus thou wilt alſo reſolve (with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) by the grace of God to labour more abundantly then others; and thou wilt often put up this queſtion to thy ſoul, ah! what ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Lord for his marverllous loving kindneſs toward me? ah! what ſhall I do? and what can I ſuffer for the honour of his great Name, whom I have ſo much diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that I may become a good example to thoſe whom I have ſo much, and ſo oft ſcandalized? thou muſt, after that, be (in ſome ſort) a non-ſuch, if thou be ſuch as thou ought'ſt to be.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may ſee that the preſent point, though moſt dreadfull and terrible, yet doth not exclude any mourning penitent from pardon. But laſtly, that no obſtruction may ſeem to lye in the way of ſuch, we will ſpeak a word for clearing that place, <hi>Prov</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. &amp;c. where the Lord threatneth to reject all their tears, prayers, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. ſome perhaps may think to elude the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difficulty, by affirming the meaning of that threatning not to be abſolute, but conditional, ſo that we may not from thence conclude that any, who was in ſuch a caſe, ever did, or ſhall cordially pray to God, and that he will refuſe to anſwer their effectual fervent prayers; ſince, only by way of ſuppoſition, it is ſaid, though they ſhould call, yet he would not anſwer nor regard their complaint; as the offer of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, made to the reprobat, if they believe and repent, doth not import that any ſuch ever did, or ſhall repent and be ſaved; So on the other hand, neither doth this threatning imply, that any, who fall under it, ſhould in truth call upon the Lord, and he hide his face from their prayers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Lord pour out the Spirit of prayer upon thee,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:47554:415"/>this threatning needs not diſcourage thee; but thou mayſt be confident, that either thy name is taken out of that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or that it was never included in it.</p>
                  <p>But this anſwer ſeemeth not to be ſatisfactory, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its contrary, 1. to all the invitations and promiſes made to the penitent, what ever have been their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and courſe of life; 2. thoſe general propoſitions ſo frequently held forth in the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Cain,</hi> when he went out from the preſence of the Lord, had poured out his ſoul before the Lord, he would not have been rejected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and there is good reaſon for ſuch an hypotheſis, ſince it may be reduced to an univerſal categorick, and abſolute enunciation, <hi>viz.</hi> [All true penitents and ſincere ſupplicants, <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. were ſaved.] but that hypothetick, for which this anſwer doth plead, cannot be reſolved in any categorick that is true; nay, it hath not ſo much as one inſtance, or particular whereupon it might be built; for no man did ever ſeek after the Lord, and call upon him in truth, who did not meet with an anſwer of peace. But, 2. if that hypotheſis were true, then every door of hope muſt be ſhut againſt ſuch penitents, for though they ſhould mourn and cry to God, yet he would not hear nor anſwer; to what purpoſe then ſhould we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort ſuch to repent and call upon the Lord? there is not a word of command or exhortation in the Word, that hath not a promiſe, by way of motive and encouragment, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; and we need not run to thoſe Scriptures in which the Lord univerſally promiſeth, that whenſoever a ſinner ſhall return from the evil of his doings, and ſeek his face, he will receive him graciouſly; ſince the words immediatly, both going before and following, <hi>viz.</hi> ver. 23. and 33, do hold forth with the exhortation, to ſuch as were lying under that ſad threatning, to turn and ſeek the Lord, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:47554:415"/>and intimation of mercy, if they ſhould anſwer his call and invitation; and therefore, though this threatning be moſt peremptory, yet it doth not exclude a condition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and limitation for the manifeſtation of the riches of free grace; as hath been ſhown.</p>

We <hi>Anſ.</hi> the Lord there threatneth to reject not ſuch a prayer as we have deſcribed, and can plead a promiſe; and to which we did exhort, but ſuch a prayer as may be in hell, it being nothing elſe but a brutiſh howling, becauſe of ſome outward rod and calamity; and though ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint be directed to the Lord, (as the words, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. do imply) yet the motives being carnal, and their ends ſelfiſh, its no prayer in God's account, though it get the name, and ſuch cryers may be ſaid to call upon the Lord, yet it is not ſuch a prayer as may lay claim to a promiſe; albeit the Lord ſometimes, out of his general bounty, may anſwer ſuch a cry, and give to ſuch ſupplicants their requeſt, when he ſends leanneſs into their ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

But though thus he may pity his creatures in miſery, and anſwer their carnal deſires, yet for ſuch as are lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſad threatning, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. he will<note n="(u)" place="margin">Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus is that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but it may (as in <hi>Ahab,</hi> &amp;c.) admit a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome holy end and deſign, at which the Lord may aim at in ſuch a diſpenſation.</note> laugh at their calamity, and while they thus call upon him, he will not anſwer: we have a parallel Scripture, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.13, 14. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he threatneth to deſtroy them notwithſtanding ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal devotion, ſo he tells them, that their prayers deſerved not the name, as not proceeding from an humble and ſincere heart; <hi>We unto them, for they have fled from me; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto them, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed againſt me: and they have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they aſſemble themſelves for corn and wine, and they rebell againſt me.</hi> But though the Lord reject ſuch carnall prayers, yet this needs not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thee, who offereſt up to him a broken and contrit heart, a ſacrifice which he never did, nor will deſpiſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.18.</p>
                  <p>But, ſince the Saints are ready here to ſtumble, a word would be added for preventing their miſtake; for, as dogs
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:47554:416"/>are ready to ſnarch the childrens bread, ſo the children may gnaw the bones that are caſt to the dogs; as the wicked may lay hold on the promiſe that belongs not to them, ſo the Saints on the threatning which they need not fear; while the Maſter doth frown and is angry with his ſlothfull and unfaithfull ſervant, the child may tremble; and the hand lift up with a ſtone to be caſt at the dog, may ſtartle the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſon; though thoſe who are concerned in this ſad judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and threatning, are not affected nor awaked while they hear their dreadfull doom, yet ſome of the Lords precious ones may tremble and fear leſt this be their caſe: therefore, 1. I would have ſuch obſerve, that thoſe characters are not to be underſtood of one or two particular acts, but of a courſe, ſtate, trade and continuance in ſuch and ſuch ſins; for, what is the particular ſin, into which the Lords choſen ones (yea and after their converſion) may not fall? 2. That men and women may go a great length, and come very nigh the curſe, and yet eſcape; there is a certain meaſure in finding which the Lord hath appointed and proportioned for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as well as for temporal judgements; which we can hardly define, becauſe it is not one and the ſame to all and every one; and the Lord will uſe ſome variety, and leave us all in the dark here, that on the one hand, none might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to continue one day in their ſinfull wayes, nor to add one ſin more to that curſed heap, leſt that one ſin fill up the meaſure and bring down the judgement; and on the other hand, that none ſhould deſpair, ſo long as the Goſpel-offer and the means of grace are continued with them; and that others might be charitable, and not dare to paſs a peremptory ſentence againſt any man, as to his rejection, reprobation and eternal portion. 3. The Saints would not forget to put a difference between that <hi>partial haraneſs</hi> that remaineth in the heart after it's renovation and converſion, and that total and <hi>univerſal hardneſs</hi> of the heart before the grace of God thaw, ſoften and mollifie it; and that <hi>judicial hardneſs</hi> and induration wherewith the Lord in his judgement plagueth ſecure ſinners, while he giveth them up to the luſts of their own heart; which is yet worſe then the former, it being a
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:47554:416"/>load above a load: for, although the godly may complain as of a body of ſin and death yet lodging in them, ſo of much dulneſs and indiſpoſition for ſpiritual duties, and of much deadneſs and ſlightneſs of ſpirit, under melting ordinances, and awakening diſpenſations; yet they have reaſon to praiſe God, (yea even then when they are thus mourning and complaining) that they are not lying under that total, far leſs the judicial hardneſs of heart, which is both the ſin and miſery of caſt-awayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. And though the Saints may be brought very low, and not meet with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement in prayer which others or they themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have had, yet the ſpirit of prayer is not altogether taken from them, as from thoſe who are judicially plagued and deſerted; for, though the wind do not ſo blow, nor fill their ſails as formerly, yet by a ſecret hand they are ſtill carried on in their way, and held in motion; and they may find the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to preſs and ſtir them up to their duty, though they do not ſo ſenſibly find his help and aſſiſtance in the performance of the duty.</p>

And what
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:47554:417"/>would it profit you, though you knew all that could be ſaid concerning the nature, qualifications, excellency and uſe of prayer, if ye fail and come ſhort as to the practice of it?

And now in the cloſe we ſhall only name, and briefly hint at, ſome few things; looking up to him who only can give the bleſſing, who only can perſwade and enable us to pray as we ought, and who can help us from fainting in our fervent and frequent addreſſes to the throne of Grace.</p>

And this objection hath no other ground but theſe two moſt groſs errors, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. that the Lord in his eternal counſel hath decreed the end, but not the means; 2. that the Lord hath not appointed and fixed a connexion between the means and the end. We will not ſo far digreſs as to ſhow the abſurdity of both thoſe principles, but theſe
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:47554:428"/>being rejected as unworthy to be owned by any who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, yea, or to know the firſt principles of reaſon; the decrees of God are ſo far from diſcharging us of our duty, that they may be a notable encouragment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and particularly as to prayer.

And though we had no particular revelation as to the event, yet when we conſider the wiſdom and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Gods counſell, we may very confidently go to the throne of grace, expecting that he (who hath appointed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain) having put a word in our mouth, will alſo fill our hands: and his decree being immutable, and he having appointed prayer to be a mean for obtaining what we ſtand in need of, and promiſed ſucceſs thereto, we need not fear, leſt he cauſe us<note n="(p)" place="margin">Iſa. 45.19.</note> ſeek his face in vain. Why then ſhould we vex our ſelves with unwarrantable and needleſs queſtions concerning Gods decrees? or ask whether he hath decreed to give or with-hold ſuch a mercy? Thou art beyond thy ſphere, and wilt find no place to reſt, ſo long as thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this wilderneſs; the decrees of God are a depth thou canſt not fathom, <hi>ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God,</hi> but he hath revealed to us our duty, <hi>that we may do all the words of his law,</hi> Deut. 29.29. Let us not then be <hi>anxious</hi> concerning <hi>events;</hi> the Lord knoweth what he will do, and what is beſt to be done to us and for us; but let us be <hi>ſollicitous</hi> concerning our duty, committing the ſucceſs to him who will with-hold no good thing from his honeſt ſervants, nor ſuffer one word of promiſe to want its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; let us not then ask <hi>what God will do?</hi> but what <hi>we ſhould do?</hi> and if nothing will ſatisfie our curioſity untill we be acquainted with Gods ſecrets, let us then take the right courſe; let us not thus begin at the wrong and upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end of the ladder, and deſcend, before we aſcend; it were better and ſafer to learn from our way and work ſome thing of Gods purpoſe concerning us, then to enquire after our duty in the Lords ſecret decrees, which are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:47554:429"/>revealed to us, but by his Word and Works. If then, 1. thou haſt a promiſe; and, 2. if thou meet with ſtrength for doing thy duty, thou may'ſt propheſie the event and ſucceſs (without any hazard of being accounted an enthuſiaſt) for thou mayſt know, that what ever be the Lords decrees concerning the futurition of events, yet there is no decree which needs, 1. diſcourage thee who art in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity ſeeking his face; or which, 2. can<note n="(q)" place="margin">Its obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a known decree did give no <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> from prayer to Chriſt though a Son, for in that decree, <hi>Pſ. 2.6, 7.</hi> was included, his kingdom, and that he ſhould have the utmoſt ends of the earth for a poſſeſſion, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding muſt be askt by him, <hi>ver. 8.</hi>

And I think ſtrange that any ſhould ſcruple to yield to this: but for preventing a miſtake, it would be conſidered, that it were abſured to imagine that the Lord could be moved or turned from his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and decree; thus there is<note n="(u)" place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note>
